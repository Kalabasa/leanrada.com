		The <strong>Quine-McCluskey algorithm</strong> is a method used for minimization 
		of boolean functions developed by W.V. Quine and Edward J. McCluskey in 1956.
		It takes a boolean expression and converts it into its simplified 
		<strong>sum-of-products</strong> representation.
		<p><strong>QMSolver</strong> is an implementation of the Quine-McCluskey algorithm
		written in JavaScript with an HTML/CSS frontend.</p>

		Using <strong>QMSolver</strong> is very easy. Simply enter the <i>minterm indices</i>
		and the <i>number of variables of the function</i> in their  respective fields. 
		Minterm indices should be <strong>separated by spaces</strong>. You can opt not to
		enter anything in the "number of variables" field. Leaving it blank will make QMSolver
		automatically use the minimum number of variables possible based on the minterm indices
		you have entered.
		<p>After giving your input, there is no more need to press Enter or to click a "Solve!"
		button. The resulting minimized function will be immediately displayed in the output area,
		and any changes with the input will trigger a recalculation.</p>
		<p>The example below has inputs 2, 3, 5, and 8 for the minterm indices and 5 for the number
		of variables.</p>

		<strong>I entered <i>[asdfghjkl]</i> but there's no output!</strong>
		<p>First off, QMSolver doesn't have any error handling for inputs. Sorry.
		We didn't feel the need to include it anymore after considering performance,
		stability, and security. QMSolver tries its best to read the numbers from your input
		though, so there's a good chance it will still work even with broken input.
		For best results, just follow the format!</p>
		<strong>My OS is <i>[this], [that], etc</i>. Is that supported?</strong>
		<p>Most probably, yes. QMSolver is written in JavaScript and HTML/CSS. It should work
		with whatever operating system you are on, as long as you use a browser that supports
		JavaScript.</p>
		<strong>My browser is <i>[this], [that], etc</i>. Is that supported?</strong>
		<p>Most probably, yes. QMSolver is guaranteed to work on any modern browser. We're not
		sure about IE6 and below, though. Heh.</p>
		<strong>My computer/browser freezes while using QMSolver! Why?</strong>
		<p>You're also probably getting something along the lines of "error:
		non-responsive script". That just means that QMSolver is taking too long to process
		your input. This usually happens with minterms that need a lot of variables. It will
		still depend on your machine, though. On older machines, freezing has occured on as few
		as 5 variables. On newer machines, freezing usually starts at the 22-variable mark.
		As of this writing, there is no solution but to either wait for the QMSolver to finish
		processing, or to force-close your browser if it has become non-responsive for too long.</p>
		<strong>How did you incorporate syntax highlighting for the documentation page?</strong>
		<p>We used <a href = "http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/" target = "_blank">this</a>.</p>
		<strong>This is awesome! Can I copy / use this in my own projects?</strong>
		<p>...probably, yeah. We still haven't decided upon a license to release QMSolver with,
		but we will probably be getting something non-restrictive; something that would allow
		redistribution and modification as long as credit is given where credit is due.</p>
		<strong>You guys are awesome! Will you have my babies?</strong>
		<p>Right now we have no plans of fathering children, so no. But thanks!
