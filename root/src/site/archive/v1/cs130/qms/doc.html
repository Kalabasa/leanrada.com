		As QMSolver is written in JavaScript and HTML/CSS, its source code can be viewed anytime 
		using just your browser. Nevertheless, here are direct links to QMSolver's source code.
		<p align = "center"><a href = "res/qm.js" target = "_blank">plain text</a> |
		<a href = "src.html">prettified</a></p>
		<p>The source code by itself is well commented and relatively easy to understand. However,
		there is one particular function, <strong>findEsPrImplicants</strong>, that needs a more 
		in-depth discussion. It will be covered below.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class ="box content">
		<div class = "contitle">overview</div>
		The <strong>findEsPrImplicants</strong> (find essential prime implicants) implements
		the Quine-McCluskey algorithm.
		There are three parts in this function.
		In the Quine-McCluskey algorithm, there are two parts.
		These two parts, combining implicants and the prime implicant chart, are the last two parts
		of this function.
		<p>The three parts of the function are:
		<ol>
			<li>Converting minterms to implicants</li>
			<li>Combining implicants to find prime implicants</li>
			<li>Finding essential prime implicants (Prime implicant chart)</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		<p>Each will be covered below. There are other functions and definitions as well.
		The <strong>util</strong> object contains utility functions for ease in development. There is
		a class, the <strong>Implicant</strong> class, that represents an implicant. Other functions are
		mostly for formatting and parsing. The source may be viewed if one wants to learn more about
		these utility elements.</p>
		<p>Have fun.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class ="box content">
		<div class = "contitle">part one: minterms to implicants</div>
		The function will receive as argument an integer array containing the minterm indices.
<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 199;">
    // Construct initial table, get implicants from minterms
    var implicants = [];
     
    var mt, obits, iarr, imp;
    var i, n;
    for(i = 0, n = minterms.length; i &lt n; i++){
        mt = minterms[i] = parseInt(minterms[i]);
        imp = createImplicantWithMinterm(mt);
        imp.setPrime(true); // assume prime until proven guilty
         
        obits = util.popCount(mt);
        iarr = implicants[obits] = implicants[obits] || [];
        iarr.push(imp);
    }
</pre>
		First, a data structure is built from and for the minterms so that they would
		be easier to manipulate. This data structure is the Implicant class.
<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 205;">
mt = minterms[i] = parseInt(minterms[i]);
imp = createImplicantWithMinterm(mt);
</pre>
		<strong>createImplicantWithMinterm</strong> returns an Implicant object that
		represents the minterm index <strong>mt</strong>. We then have to store these 
		Implicant objects in an array such that they would be arranged like this:
<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; gutter: false;">
implicants[0] = [000] // 0 one bits
implicants[1] = [001, 010, 100] // 1 one bits
implicants[2] = [011, 101, 110] /// 2 one bits
implicants[3] = [111] // 3 one bits
</pre>
		Note that the number of <strong>1</strong> bits in a minterm should be the same as
		its index. To store the Implicants in this way, the number of one bits is counted.
<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 209;">
obits = util.popCount(mt);
iarr = implicants[obits] = implicants[obits] || [];
iarr.push(imp);
</pre>
		<p>Using the <strong>popCount</strong> function we can get the number of one bits, and thus the array index of the Implicants.
		<strong>popCount</strong> returns the number of 1 bits of the first argument.</p>
		<img src = "res/1.png" alt = "Implicant objects"></img>		
	</div>
	
	<div class ="box content">
		<div class = "contitle">part two: finding prime implicants</div>
		We now have an <strong>Implicants array</strong> where they are grouped based on their number of
		1 bits ({000}, {001,010}, ..., {111}). We should now be able to combine the implicants.
		The process of combining the implicants occurs at the do-while loop.
<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 222;">
	do{
		hasCombined = false;
		nextImplicants = [];
		for(i = 0, n = implicants.length - 1; i &lt n; i++){
			// for each pair of adjacent rows
			g1 = implicants[i] = implicants[i] || [];
			g2 = implicants[i+1] = implicants[i+1] || [];
			
			// for each implicant in both rows
			for(j = 0, m = g1.length; j &lt m; j++){
				imp1 = g1[j];
				for(k = 0, o = g2.length; k &lt o; k++){
					imp2 = g2[k];
					
					// combine implicants
					comb = imp1.combine(imp2);
					if(comb){
						iarr = nextImplicants[i] = nextImplicants[i] || [];
						iarr.push(comb);
						
						imp1.setPrime(false);
						imp2.setPrime(false);
						comb.setPrime(true);
						hasCombined = true;
					}
				}
			}
		}
		
		// store uncombined implicants as prime implicants
		for(i = 0, n = implicants.length; i &lt n; i++){
			g1 = implicants[i];
			for(j = 0, m = g1.length; j &lt m; j++){
				imp = g1[j];
				if(imp.prime){
					primeImplicants.push(imp);
				}
			}
		}
		
		implicants = nextImplicants;
	}while(hasCombined);
</pre>
		<p>For every pair of adjacent groups, we check each implicant if they can be combined. For
		example, the two groups {001,010,100}, {011,101} are adjacent and shall undergo the checking.</p>

<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 225;">
	for(i = 0, n = implicants.length - 1; i &lt n; i++){
		// for each pair of adjacent rows
		g1 = implicants[i] = implicants[i] || [];
		g2 = implicants[i+1] = implicants[i+1] || [];
</pre>
	For every pair of adjacent groups, <strong>g1</strong> and <strong>g2</strong>...
<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 230;">
		// for each implicant in both rows
		for(j = 0, m = g1.length; j &lt m; j++){
			imp1 = g1[j];
			for(k = 0, o = g2.length; k &lt o; k++){
				imp2 = g2[k];
</pre>
		We check each implicant <strong>imp1</strong> and <strong>imp2</strong>
		which come from groups <strong>g1</strong> and <strong>g2</strong>, respectively.
<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 236;">
	// combine implicants
	comb = imp1.combine(imp2);
</pre>
		Here we try to combine the implicants. The <strong>combine</strong> method of the <strong>Implicant</strong>
		attempts to combine two implicants, and returns the combined <strong>Implicant</strong> if successful, otherwise
		it returns <strong>null</strong>. As stated in the Quine-McCluskey algorithm, two implicants are combined if
		they are adjacent in Gray code (they differ in one bit).
<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 238;">
	if(comb){
		iarr = nextImplicants[i] = nextImplicants[i] || [];
		iarr.push(comb);

		imp1.setPrime(false);
		imp2.setPrime(false);
		comb.setPrime(true);
		hasCombined = true;
	}
</pre>
		If combining is successful, the results are stored in a <strong>nextImplicants
		array</strong> for the next round of combining. This is akin to transferring the
		grouped implicants to the next column in a manual Quine-McCluskey pen-and-paper
		implementation.
		<p>Since <strong>imp1</strong> and <strong>imp2</strong> have been combined, they
		are no longer prime. <strong>setPrime(false)</strong> is called on them. It is assumed
		that the resulting combination is prime. The next iteration will determine whether the
		new <strong>Implicant</strong> is truly prime.</p>
		<p><strong>hasCombined</strong> is then set to true.</p>
		<img src = "res/2.png" alt = "Compine imlpicants"></img>
		<p>After combining in this column, we store the implicants that weren't combined
		because they are now our <strong>Prime implicants</strong>.</p>
<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 251;">
	// store uncombined implicants as prime implicants
	for(i = 0, n = implicants.length; i &lt n; i++){
		g1 = implicants[i];
		for(j = 0, m = g1.length; j &lt m; j++){
			imp = g1[j];
			if(imp.prime){
				primeImplicants.push(imp);
			}
		}
	}
</pre>
		Check every group (<strong>g1</strong>) and every implicant in the group
		(<strong>imp = g1[j]</strong>). If the implicant is prime, then it is pushed
		into the <strong>primeImplicants array</strong>.
<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 262;">
	implicants = nextImplicants;
</pre>	
		We then proceed to the next round of combining. The process is repeated until there are no more implicants to combine.
		We check for the <strong>hasCombined</strong> flag to check whether to stop the loop.
<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 263;">
	}while(hasCombined);
</pre>

		The <strong>hasCombined</strong> will be false when there are no more implicants to combine.
		After the loop, the prime implicants are now identified and stored.

<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 273;">
	// remove duplicates
	for(i = primeImplicants.length-1; i >= 0; i--){
		for(j = i-1; j >= 0; j--){
			imp1 = primeImplicants[i];
			imp2 = primeImplicants[j];
			
			if(imp1.binary == imp2.binary && imp1.dnm == imp2.dnm){
				imp2.minterms = imp1.minterms.length > imp2.minterms.length ? imp1.minterms : imp2.minterms;
				primeImplicants.splice(i, 1);
				break;
			}
		}
	}
</pre>

	Lastly, duplicate prime implicants are removed to avoid problems later.
	</div>
	
	<div class = "box content">
		<div class = "contitle">part 3: finding essential prime implicants</div>
		
		Now we have a <strong>Prime implicants array</strong> containing our prime implicants.
		The next step is to identify which of these prime implicants are essential prime implicants.
		<p>To find the essential prime implicants, check each of the given minterms and count
		the implicants that "cover" the minterm. A minterm that is covered by only one implicant
		is covered by an essential implicant. So, if the implicant count is one, then that one implicant
		is essential.
		</p>
		
		<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 295;">
			// find "covers" for each minterm
			for(i = primeImplicants.length-1; i>=0; i--){
				imp = primeImplicants[i];
				for(j = imp.minterms.length-1; j>=0; j--){
					mintermCovers[imp.minterms[j]].push(imp);
				}
			}
		</pre>
		
		Each prime implicant is processed. So, for each minterm of the implicant,
		the implicant is pushed into an array for that minterm.
		
		<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 298;">
			for(j = imp.minterms.length-1; j>=0; j--){
				mintermCovers[imp.minterms[j]].push(imp);
			}
		</pre>
		
		The <strong>mintermCovers</strong> array is an <strong>array of arrays of Implicants.</strong>
		It is arranged such that there is an array for each minterm; and in that inner array,
		the implicants covering the corresponding minterm are contained.
		<p>In the following example, the minterms are 1, 3, 4, and 5; so we will have three prime implicants
		0-1, -01, and 10-. The <strong>mintermCovers</strong> array will be like this:</p>
		<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; gutter: false;">
mintermCovers[1] = {-01, 0-1} // implicants for minterm 1
mintermCovers[3] = {0-1} // implicants for minterm 3
mintermCovers[4] = {10-} // ...
mintermCovers[5] = {-01, 10-}
		</pre>
		Note that the index of each implicant array is the corresponding minterm.
		Now the counting/tallying part is done, we can easliy identify which prime implicants are essential.
		<p>The essential prime implicants are those that are alone in the array. In other words, those that are
		in a one-length array are essential prime implicants. In the example, they are 0-1, and 10-.</p>
		
		<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; gutter: false;">
mintermCovers[3] = {0-1}	
mintermCovers[4] = {10-}
		</pre>
		
		<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 303;">
			// finding essential prime implicants
			var covers;
			for(i = mintermCovers.length-1; i>=0; i--){
				covers = mintermCovers[i];
		</pre>
		Each minterm covers array is checked.
		<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 307;">
				if(covers && covers.length == 1){
					// minterm with single cover is covered by an essential prime implicant
					imp = covers[0];
					essentialImplicants.push(imp);
		</pre>
		<p>If the length is one, it means there is only one cover, which means that that implicant is essential.
		The implicant is pushed into an <strong>essentialImplicants</strong> array.</p>
		<img src = "res/3.png" alt = "Find essential prime implicants"></img>
		<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 311;">
					for(j = imp.minterms.length-1; j>=0; j--){
						mintermCovers[imp.minterms[j]].length = 0;
					}
				}
			}
		</pre>
		For each essential prime implicant found, we must erase other implicants
		in <strong>mintermCovers</strong> that overlaps with the essential implicant. So, for each minterm
		of the essential implicant, we clear the implicant array corresponding to the minterm.
		
		<p>We now have our essential prime implicants, but not all minterms are covered by the essential implicants.
		This happens when the implicants overlap each other in a specific way. That is, they form a circular chain
		of overlapping implicants. These non-essential uncovered implicants must still
		be included to complete the function.</p>
		
		<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 340;">
			// find minterms left uncovered by essential implicants
			//  (all)
			for(i = mintermCovers.length-1; i>=0; i--){
			    covers = mintermCovers[i];
			    if(covers && covers.length){
		</pre>
		Each cover array is checked again. Note that some cover arrays are already cleared by the essential prime
		implicants. Here we are now checking for those that are not cleared. We check the length if it is not zero.
		<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 340;">
				imp = covers[0];
				essentialImplicants.push(imp);
				for(j = imp.minterms.length-1; j>=0; j--){
				    mintermCovers[imp.minterms[j]].length = 0;
				}
			    }
			}
		</pre>
		If we find some remaining implicants, the same procedure as above applies: clear all covered minterms.
		<p>In the code, there is another block <strong>(lines 317-338)</strong> that preceeds this block.
		They are the same, except that the other filters the implicants found. This is to improve the final
		function, by preventing redundant prime implicants from being added. In the block, the implicants found
		are filtered such that those that don't overlap with other non-essential implicants are added, otherwise
		ignored.</p>
		
		<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 353;">
			// sort
			for(i = essentialImplicants.length-1; i>=0; i--){
				essentialImplicants[i].minterms.sort();
			}
		</pre>
		Just some sorting
		<pre class="brush: js; toolbar: false; first-line: 358;">
			return essentialImplicants;
		</pre>
		and it is done. Woo!
