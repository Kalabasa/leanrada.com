## Chill music to quarantine to.

**Isolation** (2020) is a single I composed during the 2020 pandemic.

I made it using LMMS and Audacity, which are both free and open-source software for music and audio production.

In this piece I leaned heavily on the [**voices**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_leading) that make up the harmony. Voices are the individual melodic lines that when combined make harmony.

Instead of deciding on the chord progression and structures beforehand, the individual melodic lines ("voices") led the way. It’s a bottom-up kind of way.

<small>I think it’s called [**counterpoint**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint) in classical terms. Maybe.</small>

So the resulting chord progression was this:

<div style="text-align:center">
	<strong>Em</strong><sup>7</sup>&emsp;
	<strong>E</strong><sup>o♭6</sup>&emsp;
	<strong>F</strong><sup>M7</sup>&emsp;
	<strong>F</strong><sup>o7</sup>
</div>
<small>Key: <strong>C</strong></small>

The result was a floaty kind of feeling, with no particularly strong movements. There’s constant tension which is not fully resolved.

The movement of the music was driven rather by the individual voice lines.

	</div>

For the bass, it’s the same. It was written to accompany the harmony:

<div style="text-align:center">
	<sup>Em / </sup><strong>C</strong>&emsp;
	<sup>E<sup>o</sup> / </sup><strong>B♭</strong>&emsp;
	<sup>F / </sup><strong>A</strong>&emsp;
	<sup>F<sup>o</sup> / </sup><strong>A♭</strong><br/>
	<sup>Em / </sup><strong>E</strong>&emsp;
	<sup>E<sup>o</sup> / </sup><strong>E</strong>&emsp;
	<sup>F / </sup><strong>F</strong>&emsp;
	<sup>F<sup>o</sup> / </sup><strong>F</strong>
</div>

<small>I think the bass turned out to be a big factor in the music’s motion, especially with the <strong>F</strong> going back to <strong>C</strong> movement.</small>

They all worked together to create a steady and chill sound to quarantine to.

There were no choruses or big movements because that’s not chill; that’s drama.
