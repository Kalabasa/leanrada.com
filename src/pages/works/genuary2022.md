# Genuary 2022

## 1 month of generative art

As 2022 rolled in, I stumbled upon a site called <a href="https://genuary.art/" target="_blank">genuary.art</a>. Itâ€™s a month of daily creative coding challenges, like Inktober for programmers. The output is a generative art piece per day.

Having done some <a href="dimension1.html">generative art</a> in the past, I committed myself to the challenge. Sounds like fun!
