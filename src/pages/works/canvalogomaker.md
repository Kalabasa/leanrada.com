## Online logo generator

Logo Maker is a tool that generates a customized logo in Canva. You supply the brand name, style, and colors; it will do the rest! ✨ <small>Actually, color customization isn’t available yet, but will be soon!</small>

My role in this project was the implementation of the landing page and the “choices” modal interface.

I also did some integration with our internal design API, but the amazing Smart Design team did the magic! They made a design system that generates dynamic pixel-perfect designs with several parameters!

Once the design is generated, it can be further customized using in the Canva Editor.

This cool project was made possible by the cool people at Canva - spanning multiple teams, from graphic designers to product engineers! It was a fun journey!
