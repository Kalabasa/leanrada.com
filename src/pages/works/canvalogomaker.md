## Online logo generator

**Logo Maker** (2018) is a tool that generates a customized logo in Canva. You supply the brand name, style, and colors; it will do the rest! ✨ <small>(Actually, color customization isn’t available yet, but will be soon!)</small>

I also did some integration with our internal design API, but the amazing Smart Design team did the magic! They made a design system that generates dynamic pixel-perfect designs with several parameters!

Once the design is generated, it can be further customized in the Canva Editor.
