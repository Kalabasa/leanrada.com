The piano is easily my favorite musical instrument. It’s a very versatile and expressive instrument.

I’ve been meaning to create good music out of it for a long time. There were attempts, but it is only now that I had the knowledge and capability to create music that I want. So I compiled an album.

The album is made up of four short piano pieces. Each piece was supposed to represent a single thought or mood, and that is why they are short.

I focused more on the texture or *feels* of the core idea of each piece, so there’s not much structure within each piece.

I think what came out was good enough. Hope this sounds pleasant to your ears!

Some of my musical influences in piano were **Chopin**, **Isaac Shepard**, and **Yiruma**. Although I grew up loving classical pieces, I have now come to like contemporary piano music as well.

Since my teen years, piano music has always been a source of calmness. I play it as a release of emotion. I don’t play as much these days though.

My long-time favorite piano pieces are:
* **Canon in D** (Pachelbel) <sup>[[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNsgHMklBW0)</sup>
* **Nocturne op.9 no.2** (Chopin) <sup>[[YouTube]](https://youtu.be/9E6b3swbnWg)</sup>
* **Clair de Lune** (Debussy) <sup>[[YouTube]](https://youtu.be/vKV7C1HKVOY)</sup>
* **Before Dawn** (Isaac Shepard) <sup>[[YouTube]](https://youtu.be/t_R42kpFpJE)</sup>
* **Kiss the Rain** (Yiruma) <sup>[[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imGaOIm5HOk)</sup>
