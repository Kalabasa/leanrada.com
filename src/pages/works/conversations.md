## Chill jazzhop music.

**Conversations** is a four-piece composition of mellow hip-hop beats, jazz harmony, and mild piano improvisations.

Influences range from jazz, funk, and bossa nova to lo-fi, hip-hop, and new-age.

The goal of this project was for me to learn the full music production process, from composing, to mixing and mastering, to publishing.

This is my first music published on a platform like Spotify.

Over the course of the project, I have learned a lot. I watched music theory on YouTube, experimented with signal processing techniques and other plugins, and practiced mixing and mastering.

The final product may not be the best, but it’s a learning experience, so I can say that the project was a success.

I’ve been making music since 15, more or less. Music is yet another hobby of mine aside from programming. Starting with [Notessimo](https://www.notessimo.net), to DAWs like [LMMS](https://lmms.io/), I’ve made music ranging from solo piano pieces to electronic dance music. I have also tried [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/flstudio).

Have a listen on [**Spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/album/2LEKLuoWYauyAlQ8JwoPc2).

Or be a little more generous on [**Bandcamp**](http://lreaadna.bandcamp.com/album/conversations).
