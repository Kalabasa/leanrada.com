# #CanvaPasko

## Christmas designed by you!

**#CanvaPasko** was an online design contest where winning designs got featured on a billboard.

The project aimed to empower everyone to design beautiful Christmas cards and take pride in showing their love in a big way!

My role in this project was the implementation of the contest microsite where people created and submitted their entries.

It featured a **live preview** where you can preview your design by typing a name right on the home page.

</video>

After selecting a template, the Canva editor will pop up. You can design and submit your greeting card right then and there.

The pop-up Canva editor embedded in the page was from a new product from Canva called the [**Canva Button**](https://www.canva.com/button/). Using the Canva Button SDK, developers can integrate the Canva editor into their own website.

My favorite part of the microsite was the design page.

It featured an **interactive animated background** and a **billboard preview** of the participant’s newly-created design.

These animations were implemented in pure CSS so it doesn’t interfere with the main thread. <small>Except the spinny physics.</small>

The billboard preview should help the participant visualize their prize should they win.

These animations overall aimed to delight and motivate the participants to continue and wrap up their entry by following the instructions and posting to social media.

The contest ran for about one month and got around a thousand entries.

Out of all submissions, 20 winners were selected to be displayed on the prize billboard, strategically located near the traffic chokepoint that is the Guadalupe Bridge in EDSA.

But really the best thing about this project was the participant’s entries themselves. It wouldn’t be called _“Designed By You”_ for nothing!

Some of the stories accompanying the entries were really inspiring. Here are some of them from the [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/CanvaPhilippines/videos/420974562128240/).

There are lots of messages about family and love that have emerged through the contest.

One particular winner got a special surprise — a Canva-sponsored homecoming and reunion with their family in the Philippines!

I really like how Canva as a company tries to make these magical moments, whether it’s small things like little UI easter eggs, or bigger things like this contest. Seeing a billboard dedicated to you must be amazing.

It’s very nice to have worked on a project like this that impacted people on a personal level. I never really expected this outcome.

Seeing all the responses and reactions made all the nights at the office worth it <small>(aside from the extra overtime pay, that is. 👌)</small>
