## Edit photos online

**Photo Editor** is an online tool by Canva for simple image editing. It features pre-set filters, simple adjustment sliders, crop, resize, and rotation tools.

This tool existed primarily as a way to promote the main design platform [Canva](https://www.canva.com). Users coming in to edit photos are likely to have more design needs than image editing, so there are a few promotional paths to Canva in the photo editor itself.

The Photo Editor had a previous version which was made by a third party developer in a proprietary framework on top of Angular 1 and Node 5. It was a bit difficult to maintain and iterate on. It was also not responsive so we're missing out on mobile users.

A redesign and rewrite was needed for future improvement.

So around Summer 2019 <small>(Australian Summer 2018â€“2019)</small>, a redesign was made and the app was rewritten in a more modern stack. The revamped version looks better, more modern, and is responsive.

My part in this redesign was the coding of the webapp and the landing page.

I chose to write the app in [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) with [**MobX**](https://mobx.js.org/). MobX really helped simplify the state management of the whole app.

There are a few WebGL and canvas filter algorithms from the old app that I reimplemented. I had to dip my toes into some fragment shaders for the WebGL version. The app uses [**glfx.js**](http://evanw.github.io/glfx.js/) for WebGL browsers and [**CamanJS**](http://camanjs.com/) for non-WebGL browsers.

The backend is a simple server written with [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/) and the whole app was deployed on [**Heroku**](https://www.heroku.com/).

The app needs to be discoverable by search engines, and React as it is can't help with that, so an accompanying landing page was made.

The project was completed in around 2 months.

After the revamp we saw doubling in conversion rate (that is, Canva signups), so we can say that the project was a success! ðŸŽ‰

Update: The standalone app has been decommissioned, and photo editing is now part of the main app.
