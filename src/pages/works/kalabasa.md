## My place on the web.

Here is my website! It is this website you’re on right now!

I made this as an exercise to brush up my web development skills, and also to get on with the digital trends. This is actually the third iteration of my personal website.

The first one was around **2012**. I was attending college back then for my computer science degree.

This old version mainly hosted my course projects and other small games. [I did Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/kalabasa/) more back then. It also sported an interactive Flash header (now obsolete). Good times.

A second version was made in **2015**. It was more minimalist and better represented my personality.

	</video>
</span>

This one had an interactive splash screen made with [three.js](https://threejs.org).

I liked the minimal look of this one, but I somehow grew tired of it soon enough.

Eventually, I decided that a revamp was needed, bringing us what we have here right now. **2018.** The third and current version.

This current website is a static site, progressively enhanced using [**Vanilla JS**](http://vanilla-js.com), plus [**Barba.js**](http://barbajs.org) for smooth page transitions. Client-side search was made possible through [**Elasticlunr.js**](http://elasticlunr.com).

I use my own build script, which calls a bunch of other tools, like [**rollup.js**](https://rollupjs.org), [**Babel**](https://babeljs.io), [**Marked.js**](https://marked.js.org/), [**Handlebars.js**](https://handlebarsjs.com), and [**Stylus**](http://stylus-lang.com).

The build’s quite slow though. Maybe I should use Webpack like everyone else.

I chose to make it a static site because it’s fast *(supposedly)*. And also fun. And cool. Well actually, it was mostly because you can’t do server stuff on Github Pages.

This website’s source is available on [Github](https://github.com/Kalabasa/kalabasa.github.io) (duh). All the magic is in there.
