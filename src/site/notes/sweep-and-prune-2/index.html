      In the [first part](/notes/sweep-and-prune/), we figured that sorting lets us exploit the transitive property of inequality to optimise the number of pairwise tests.
      
      We ended up with - let‚Äôs call it a **‚Äúsimplified version‚Äù**, of the full sweep-and-prune algorithm.
      
      This part explores the more sophisticated versions of sweep-and-prune.

      ## Proper sweep-and-prune üßê

      Let‚Äôs see how the original version tackled the problem (Not sure which one‚Äôs original, tbh).

      First, sorting widthy objects.

      To account for the width of objects while keeping the benefits of unambiguous sort order, we track the left and the right edges of each object as two separate points.

      This is done by maintaining a separate __array of edge points__ corresponding to the objects‚Äô left & right edges.

      See how it works by playing with this <span class="drag-hint">draggable</span> demo. The left and right edges of each ball are visualised. These edge points are stored in a sorted array shown below the box.

      <div class="demo-row">
        <sap-demo
          id="edges-demo"
          balls="4"
          strategy="sap-nativesort"
          static draggable rainbow
          decorations="edges" />
        Sorted array of edges:
        <div class="edges-array" data-target="#edges-demo"></div>
      </div>

      Of course, we need to initialise the edge data and continually keep them in sync with the objects. I‚Äôll leave that out as an implementation detail.

      <code-block :code="`\
// todo: extract 2 edges from each object into the array
let edges: Array<{
  object: Object;  // parent object
  x: number;       // x-coordinate
  isLeft: boolean; // true if left edge. false if right
}>;`" />

      This sorted array of edges is all we need to facilitate the reduction of unnecessary pairwise tests.

      ### Index as position, position as index
      
      Remember the `intersects()` function? Let‚Äôs focus only on the x-axis checks:

      <code-block :code="`\
function intersects(object1, object2) {
  return object1.left < object2.right
      && object1.right > object2.left
      /* ... */;
}`" />

      We can replace these x-coordinate comparisons with a new approach based on array indices. Since we have a sorted array of every object‚Äôs left and right points, finding x-overlaps can be done via index-based searches rather than global pairwise testing.

      Take one ball for example. Get the indices of its left and right points, and you can simply run in between those two points in the array to find all x-overlapping objects! This is a very fast linear operation.

      Here‚Äôs a viz. Try <span class="drag-hint">dragging</span> the <span style="color:#4c8">highlighted ball</span> below and observe the edges enclosed visually and in the sorted array:

      <div class="demo-row">
        <sap-demo
          id="edges-demo-one"
          balls="5"
          strategy="sap-nativesort" 
          static draggable
          decorations="edges:focus:#4c8:#d88" />
        Sorted array of edges:
        <div class="edges-array" data-target="#edges-demo-one"></div>
      </div>

      The above is a simple 1-to-n overlap detection (which is flawed, btw). For n-to-n overlap detection, turns out there is a neat way to find all overlapping pairs in a single pass!

      ## Chapter 2. Sweeping

      To generalise the above to an n-interval overlap scan, imagine a vertical line sweeping across the whole space from left to right. The sweep line keeps track of the objects it is currently touching.

      Let‚Äôs see what that looks like without collision:

      <div class="demo-row">
        <sap-demo
          balls="5"
          no-bounce
          strategy="sap-nativesort"
          skip-interval="6"
          decorations="sweep:#f00:#d88,edges" />
        <div class="demo-caption">
          Objects touching the line are lit up in <span style="color:#d88">pink</span>.
        </div>
      </div>

      As for the implementation, the line is merely a metaphor. It‚Äôs just a visualisation of an iteration through the sorted list of edges.

      To keep track of objects touching the line, we maintain a set called <span style="color:#d88">`touching`</span> in code.
      
      Whenever the line runs into an object (a left edge), the object is added to the set. Likewise, whenever it exits an object (right edge), the object is removed from the set.

      <code-block :code="`\
sort(edges);

const touching = new Set();
for (const edge of edges) {
  if (edge.isLeft) {
    // entering an object
    touching.add(edge.object);
  } else {
    // exiting an object
    touching.delete(edge.object);
  }
}`" />

      Once we have the sweep working, detecting overlaps is easy&hellip;
      
      üëâ Whenever the sweep line enters a new object (a left edge), in addition to inserting it to `touching`, we can mark it as overlapping with the rest of the objects in `touching`.

      Watch closely whenever the line enters a ball while the line is `touching` other balls. Detected overlaps are highlighted:

      <div class="demo-row">
        <sap-demo
          balls="7"
          no-bounce
          strategy="sap-nativesort"
          skip-interval="9"
          decorations="sweep:#f00:#d88,edges,checks:#4bf:600" />
        <div class="demo-caption">
          X-overlapping pairs are highlighted <span aria-label="a connecting green line" style="color:#4bf" class="pair-legend"></span> as the line sweeps.
        </div>
      </div>

      Here‚Äôs the updated code for detecting and reporting overlaps:
      
      <code-block language="diff" language-code="diff-javascript" :code="`\
  sort(edges);
  
  const touching = new Set();
  for (const edge of edges) {
    if (edge.isLeft) {
      // entering an object
+     
+     // the new object is overlapping with the existing ones
+     for (const other of touching) {
+       onOverlapX(other, edge.object);
+     }
+     
      touching.add(edge.object);
    } else {
      // exiting an object
      touching.delete(edge.object);
    }
  }`" />

      ## Chapter 3. Pruning

      `onOverlapX()` is called whenever two balls are overlapping in the x dimension. What about the other dimension, *y*? What if we‚Äôre working with 3D, how about *z*?

      Don‚Äôt worry; the sweep is just a broad-phase test, a way to _prune_ candidate pairs in bulk. There will be a narrow-phase test to determine exactly the intersections in each of the remaining pairs.

      `onOverlapX()` can be hooked up to an exact intersection test like the full `intersects()` function earlier. Or, since we already know that the argument pair overlaps in *x*, we can just check for *y*.

      <code-block :code="`\
onOverlapX = function(object1, object2) {
  // just check for y
  if (object1.top < object2.bottom
   && object1.bottom > object2.top) {
    collide(object1, object2);
  }
}`" />

      While the above formula works for most games, a more precise and time-consuming check could be done at this level since most candidates have already been pruned. Our ball example would work better with the following circle intersection test using the [Euclidean distance formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance):

      <code-block :code="`\
onOverlapX = function(object1, object2) {
  // compute circle-to-circle intersection
  const distance = sqrt(
      (object1.x - object2.x) ** 2
    + (object1.y - object2.y) ** 2
  );
  if (distance < object1.radius + object2.radius) {
    bounce(object1, object2);
  }
}`" />

      Finally, the demo:

      <div class="demo-row">
        <sap-demo
          balls="6"
          strategy="sap-nativesort"
          skip-interval="2"
          decorations="checks:#4c8" />
        <div class="demo-caption">
          Ball sim using sweep-and-prune. <code>onOverlapX()</code> calls highlighted <span aria-label="a connecting green line" style="color:#4c8" class="pair-legend"></span>.
        </div>
      </div>

      Notice that it behaves very similarly to the simplified version. It limits tests to x-overlapping pairs.

      <box-note>The sweep-and-prune algorithm is also known as sort-and-sweep.</box-note>

      ### Note for higher dimensions

      There is a variant which performs the **sweep for each axis**, not just *x*. For example in 3D, it maintains three _separate_ sorted lists of edges for x, y, and z. Indeed, this is how the full sweep-and-prune implementation works as described in the [original paper by D. Baraff](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/7115). Object pairs are flagged for overlaps separately per dimension. Pairs flagged in all dimensions would be considered intersecting.

      This is the advantage the full sweep-and-prune has over the simplified ‚Äúsorted pairwise‚Äù version. It can prune in multiple dimensions!

      <div class="demo-row">
        <sap-demo
          balls="6"
          strategy="sap-swap-2d"
          skip-interval="2"
          decorations="checks:#4c8" />
        <div class="demo-caption">
          2D sweep-and-prune. Only pairs with overlapping <text-link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume#:~:text=axis%2Daligned%20bounding%20box">AABBs</text-link> are tested <span aria-label="a connecting green line" style="color:#4c8" class="pair-legend"></span>.
        </div>
      </div>

      ## Performance of sweep-and-prune

      Here‚Äôs a side-by-side comparison of the strategies we‚Äôve covered so far! Observe the amount of intersection checks required per frame. üîç

      <div class="demo-row">
        <sap-demo
          balls="6"
          strategy="pairwise"
          skip-interval="1"
          decorations="checks:#cbb:30" />
        <div class="demo-caption">Global pairwise</div>
      </div>

      <div class="demo-row">
        <sap-demo
          balls="6"
          strategy="sap-nativesort"
          skip-interval="1"
          decorations="checks:#bcb:30" />
          <div class="demo-caption">1D sweep and prune</div>
      </div>

      <div class="demo-row">
        <sap-demo
          balls="6"
          strategy="sap-swap-2d"
          skip-interval="1"
          decorations="checks:#acb:30" />
          <div class="demo-caption">2D sweep and prune</div>
      </div>

      Let‚Äôs analyse the time complexity of 1D sweep-and-prune. üëì
      
      The sort step, again, is _O(n log n)_.
      
      The sweep, which is a linear pass with an inner loop for overlaps, should be _O(n&nbsp;+&nbsp;m)_ in the average case. Again, _m_ is the number of overlaps.
 
      <code-block :code="`\
function sweepAndPrune(edges) {
  // O(n log n)
  sort(edges);

  const touching = new Set();

  // O(n + m)
  for (const edge of edges) {
    if (edge.isLeft) {
      // O(1) at best; O(m/n) on average; O(n) at worst
      for (const other of touching) {
        onOverlapX(other, edge.object);
      }
      touching.add(edge.object); 
    } else {
      touching.delete(edge.object);
    }
  }
}`" />

      So this sweep-and-prune is ___O(n log n + m)___.

      That‚Äôs great, but it‚Äôs the same as simplified sweep-and-prune but with more code and more state to keep tabs on. *Can we improve it further?*

      ## Small detail, big improvement

      Again, let‚Äôs ask the question: Where is redundant work being done here?

      Let‚Äôs look at the sort step, which is the bottleneck of the algorithm according to the analysis.
      
      The following is a visualisation of the sorting of the edges array, using an optimised [quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) (n&nbsp;log&nbsp;n):

      <div class="demo-row">
        <sap-demo
          balls="[[50,350,50],[100,300,30],[150,200,40],[450,350,35],[500,300,30],[550,300,40]]"
          strategy="sap-quicksort"
          decorations="edges:array:#f00:#0ff"/>
        <div class="demo-caption">
          Sort <span style="color:#0ff">comparisons</span> and <span style="color:#f00">swaps</span> are highlighted. The fixed lines at the top are edge array positions, connected to actual ball edge x positions below. Line crossings signal incorrect order.
        </div>
      </div>

      You can see that most of the time, the sort does nothing at all! The list is almost always **already sorted from the previous frame**.
      
      Even when it becomes unsorted, it usually just takes a couple of swaps to be sorted again. There won‚Äôt be more than a few object boundaries changing places in one time step.

      Fortunately, the subject of sorting algorithms is well-researched. We‚Äôre dealing with the special quality of being *nearly-sorted*. And one great choice for sorting nearly-sorted lists is [**insertion sort**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)!

      <code-block :code="`\
function insertionSort(edges) {
  for (let i = 1; i < edges.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
      if (edges[j].x < edges[j + 1].x) break;
      [edges[j], edges[j + 1]] = [edges[j + 1], edges[j]];
    }
  }
}`" />

      Insertion sort has a running time of _O(n)_ at best when the list is already sorted or nearly-sorted, and _O(n<sup>2</sup>)_ at worst when the list is in reverse. We can argue that the average case is ***O(n)***, since the list is almost always sorted due to the previous frame‚Äôs sort.

      Here‚Äôs insertion sort in action:

      <div class="demo-row">
        <sap-demo
          balls="[[50,350,50],[100,300,30],[150,200,40],[450,350,35],[500,300,30],[550,300,40]]"
          strategy="sap-insertionsort"
          decorations="edges:array:#f00:#0ff"/>
        <div class="demo-caption">
          Sort <span style="color:#0ff">comparisons</span> and <span style="color:#f00">swaps</span> are highlighted.
        </div>
      </div>

      Look at it go!

      By switching to insertion sort, we‚Äôve reduced the overall average running time of sweep-and-prune to ___O(n&nbsp;+&nbsp;m)___! Awesome!

      <box-note>
        <b>Caveat:</b> It‚Äôs important to consider the primary axis of sweep-and-prune due to the sweeps plus the nature of insertion sort. It should be the axis where objects are most widely distributed to minimize swaps and overlaps.
      </box-note>

      Of course, don‚Äôt forget about our simplified sweep-and-prune from the first part. Since it has a sort step as well, we can make it insertion sort too. So it can also be _O(n&nbsp;+&nbsp;m)_! Can we ever top that?

      ## Sweeps and swaps

      Well, there is yet another way to optimise this algorithm! Hold on to your balloons, it‚Äôs about to get quite dense. ü™®

      Look at the insertion sort example above. You can observe that <span style="color:#f00">swaps</span> happen when and only **when an edge point passes through another edge point**.

      The event where an edge point passes another can be classified into four cases:

      | Case | Description |
      |------|-------------|
      | `)‚Üî(` | R edge from the west swaps with L edge from the east. |
      | `(‚Üî)` | L edge from the west swaps with R edge from the east. |
      | `(‚Üî(` | L edges swap. |
      | `)‚Üî)` | R edges swap. |

      Each swap scenario can mean something significant. Let‚Äôs look more closely into each case. 

      ### case )‚Üî(. ‚ÄúEntering‚Äù

      <blog-media
        alt="Animation of a R edge swapping with a L edge"
        :src="url('swap-rl.mp4')" />
        
      When a right edge from the west swaps with a left edge from the east, we can infer that the corresponding balls are __initiating an overlap__.

      ### case (‚Üî). ‚ÄúExiting‚Äù
      
      <blog-media
        alt="Animation of a L edge swapping with a R edge"
        :src="url('swap-lr.mp4')" />
        
      Conversely, when a left edge from the west swaps with a right edge from the east, the corresponding balls __cease to overlap__.

      ### cases (‚Üî( and )‚Üî)
      
      <blog-media
        alt="Animation of a L edge swapping with a L edge"
        :src="url('swap-ll.mp4')" />
        
      Edges of the same polarity can swap without affecting the overlappedness of their corresponding balls. We can ignore these ones.

      ## Swaps and sweeps

      Based on these swap events we can reframe the mechanics of sweep-and-prune in a new perspective, a bottom-up way centred around the swaps.

      A fun way to think about it is to pretend that a right edge is equivalent to a _localised_ sweep line. In that sense, the right edge _is_ the line sweeping over these other left edges.

      <blog-media
        alt="Animation a line sweep vs animation of an edge swap"
        :src="url('swap-as-sweep.mp4')"
        caption="An edge can be thought of as a local sweep line."/>

      Just as in a global sweep, passing over left edges will mark the corresponding balls as ‚Äútouching‚Äù; in right-edge-as-a-local-sweep version, _swapping_ left edges will mark its ball as overlapping with the right edge‚Äôs ball.
 
      In the global sweep, there is a global `touching` set keeping track of which balls are in contact with the sweep line. In local swaps, we keep track of overlaps _per ball_. (More precisely, per pair.)

      Lastly, in the global sweep, a right edge means the end of contact with a ball. In a local swap, a left edge passing over a right edge means the same thing. The corresponding balls are unmarked as overlapping.

      Essentially, instead of a global sweep line, small local ‚Äúsweeps‚Äù happen around each ball. Swaps become mini-sweeps.

      Thus we arrive at the one-dimensional sweep-and-prune‚Äôs final form:

      <code-block :code="`\
function init() {
  overlapping = new Map()
}

function sweepAndPrune(edges) {
  // Insertion sort
  for (let i = 1; i < edges.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
      if (edges[j].x < edges[j + 1].x) break;

      // Swap
      [edges[j], edges[j + 1]] = [edges[j + 1], edges[j]];

      // --- Code up until this point is plain insertion sort ---

      // These two edges have just swapped places, process it...
      const edge1 = edges[j];
      const edge2 = edges[j + 1];

      if (edge1.isLeft && !edge2.isLeft) { // case R-L ‚Üí L-R
        // Mark as overlapping
        overlapping.set(
          key(edge1, edge2),
          [edge1.ball, edge2.ball]
        );
      } else if (!edge1.isLeft && edge2.isLeft) { // case L-R ‚Üí R-L
        // Unmark as overlapping
        overlapping.delete(key(edge1, edge2));
      }
    }
  }

  return overlapping.values();
}`" />

      It‚Äôs essentially insertion sort hooked up to track overlaps.

      Let‚Äôs see it in action:

      <div class="demo-row">
        <sap-demo
          strategy="sap-swap"
          skip-interval="4"
          decorations="checks:#4c8"/>
      </div>

      While it behaves the same and has the same time complexity as the preceding variants, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs practically much more efficient in terms of processing speed. In video games where every frame has a processing budget, the actual speed matters, not just the scalability. As always, benchmarking will determine the real practical measurement of speed. (Disclaimer: I haven‚Äôt done any benchmarks!)

      | Sweep-and-prune (quicksort) | O(n log n + m)   | O(n)             | O(n)  |
      | Sweep-and-prune (insertion) | O(n + m)         | O(n)             | O(n)  |
      | Sweep-and-prune (final)     | O(n + m)         | O(n)             | O(n&nbsp;+&nbsp;m)  |

      n = number of balls, m = number of collisions

      (todo: Add benchmark here. I‚Äôm a little lazy right now. üò∫)

      The real measure of speed lies in real measurements on real hardware!

      Things I‚Äôve noted or realised while writing this post:

      * General algorithm design insights
        * Pre-sorting a list can replace a bunch of inequality checks, and unlocks:
          * Some power when linearly scanning over the list
          * Faster range / adjacency checks
          * (unrelated, but good to bring up) Binary search
        * Different sorting algorithms have situational strengths.
      * Big O, while useful, can only go so far when analysing performance.
      * I might need a frontend framework for my blog now, at least for the interactive demos.
        * Vanilla JS is starting to get scary with bigger demos like these.
        * `.mjs` is pretty good though.
