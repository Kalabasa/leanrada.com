      The following video is of a watercolour simulation made using WebGL and JavaScript.

      In this post, I explain how the simulation works with live demos along the way.

      ## Theory

      Before we dive deep into code, let us think about watercolour as a phenomenon to be modeled. After watching a bunch of videos of watercolour painting, I have come up with the following six (6) rules of watercolour.

      ## Watercolour rules

      1. Parts of the canvas can be in varying degrees of wetness.
      2. Water spreads to less wet areas.
      3. Parts of the canvas can have paint in varying amounts and colour.
      4. Water transports paint.
      5. Water evaporates over time.
      6. Paint settles over time.

      Let us interpret and implement each rule.

      ## Rule 1. Parts of the canvas can be in varying degrees of wetness.

      This can be implemented by creating a 2D greyscale image as a map of wetness, with black (0.0) representing total dryness and white (1.0) as maximum wateriness.

      <watercolor-demo rules="water" action="water" display="water" />

      You can put water by <span class="interaction-type">touching</span> the canvas, but the water does not do anything yet, so let us continue implementing the rest of the rules.

      ## Rule 2. Water spreads to less wet areas

      Since watercolour is mostly water, this rule is the most important.

      Naively, this could be implemented by applying a blur filter on the wetness map repeatedly.

      <watercolor-demo rules="water,blur-water" action="water" display="water" />

      However, it does not look right. This is because a simple blur filter cannot capture a very important property of water, **surface tension**.

      ## Rule 3. Parts of the canvas can have paint in varying amounts and colour.

      Like water, there is a 2D variable for paint too. This determines the visible colour on the canvas. We can model paint using a 2D colour image with transparency (i.e. RGBA), with each pixel representing the colour and the amount of paint at each location.

      <watercolor-demo rules="water,paint,blur-water" action="water,paint" display="water,paint" />

      They do not interact with each other yet. There are multiple interactions but we can start with the simplest one, which is the next rule.

      ## Rule 4. Water transports paint.

      <img todo alt="diagram of water transporting paint in multiple steps" />

      Whenever water moves, it carries a relative amount of paint with it. But our water does not move yet! Before we can see the results, we first need to make the water move as a simple fluid. This brings us to the next rule.

      <watercolor-demo rules="water,paint,blur-water" action="water,paint" display="water,paint" />

      ### Surface tension

      <watercolor-demo rules="water,paint,equalize" action="water,paint" />

      ### Capillary action

      ...

      <watercolor-1d-demo rules="equalize,seep" action="water,paint" />

      <watercolor-demo rules="water,paint,equalize,seep" action="water,paint" />

      ## Rule 5. Water evaporates over time.

      Subtract a small amount of water from all water surfaces over time.

      <watercolor-1d-demo rules="evaporate,equalize,seep" action="water,paint" />

      <watercolor-demo rules="water,paint,evaporate,equalize,seep" action="water,paint" />

      ## Rule 6. Paint settles over time.
