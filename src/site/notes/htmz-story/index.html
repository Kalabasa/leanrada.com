      This post is not the usual programming post. Itâ€™s been an interesting week, I guess.

      I just finished my mini side-project [**htmz**](//leanrada.com/htmz/), a snippet / library / microframework / whatever for HTML whose main feature was that it only weighed a total of **181 bytes**. It almost fits inside a single â€˜tweetâ€™ (wait, the limit is now 280 not 140?).
      
      Here is the entire framework in its final form:

      <code-block wrap="char" language="html" :code="`
&lt;iframe hidden name=htmz onload=&quot;setTimeout(()=>
document.querySelector(contentWindow.location.hash||null)
?.replaceWith(...contentDocument.body.childNodes))&quot;>&lt;/iframe>
`" />

      See the [project documentation](//leanrada.com/htmz/) for more info on what it does.

      I [posted it on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39429370), went to sleep because it was 3am at that point. Then the next morning it was at the top of HN!

      <blog-media :src="url('hn.png')" alt="screenshot of HN. Stories from February 19, 2024. 1. Show HN: htmz â€“ a low power tool for HTML (leanrada.com). 1017 points by Kalabasa 9 days ago | 242 comments" />

      I didnâ€™t expect this at all. But naturally I rushed to the comments section which quickly grew too numerous for me to read. They were generally positive, and acknowledged the projectâ€™s hackyness and elegance (these adjectives usually mean opposite things). It was pretty cool! The top comment in the thread sums it up.

      A bunch of common themes were raised. I guess Iâ€™ll write about them in this post.

      ## Why htmz?

      htmz was initially inspired by [htmx](https://htmx.org/), another web library/framework. One of htmxâ€™s main features was that it provides the capability for any element, not just the entire window, to be the target for update by an HTTP request (e.g. by clicking a link you load a partial HTML update to the page).

      <blog-media :src="url('htmx.png')" alt="Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen? By removing these constraints, htmx completes HTML as a hypertext." />

      I wondered for a bit then remembered that we already have **iframes**, a native HTML way for links to update not just the entire window, but a â€˜partâ€™ of the page. Granted, iframes are limited and not as dynamic as some of htmxâ€™s operations like appends and deletions.

      So I set out to make an iframe-only solution to this class of problems. htmz initially stood for **â€˜htmx zeroâ€™** or something like that, because you need exactly zero JavaScript to be able to use iframes, while htmx stood at around 16 kB compressed (decompresses to a total of 48 kB of JavaScript!). Minimising the amount of code needed was the primary goal from the start.
      
      Eventually, the original iframe solution evolved to support most of the usual operations like deletions, and a *bit* of JS was required after all. htmz was then backronymised as *<b>H</b>tml with <b>T</b>argeted <b>M</b>anipulation <b>Z</b>ones*.

      ## Was it a joke?

      *(short answer: maybe)*

      Starting with the name itself, htmz sounded like a parody of the more popular htmx. I thought it was obvious that this project was just a fun hack to share.

      But some people took it too seriously. I know, this is HN, where serious startups and stuff are posted daily. Or rather, this is the Internet.
      
      I was reminded of [Poeâ€™s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law). On the other hand, the initial documentation for the project did give mixed vibes (it was a half-joke half-solution project after all). And the marketing bits were too good for the projectâ€™s own good.
      
      <blog-media :src="url('logo.png')" caption="This project has a favicon while htmx.org has none. Marketing overload! But really, I just enjoy polishing the little details in projects." />

      Orrr maybe Iâ€™m the only one who finds humour in a section called â€˜Installingâ€™ that, instead of telling you to install a package, tells you to simply copy a snippet. Orrr what about when â€˜Extensionsâ€™ are not plugins but code you actually have to write yourself&hellip; Ha! Get it? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Subversion of expectations, anyone? No? OK, fine&hellip;

      In any case, I had my fun writing these aspects of the project!
      
      I made an npm package for good measure:
      
      <blog-media :src="url('npm.png')" alt="For npm enjoyers, use the following npm commands to automate the simple process of copying the snippet. For maximum npm enjoyment, this npm package contains 25 bonus dependencies!" />

      ## Code golfing
      
      Some commenters pointed out insights which led to significant reductions in the size of the snippet. Some even made pull requests, that I reviewed and merged (Am I an â€˜open-source maintainerâ€™ yet?).
      
      My initial release started with **181** bytes:

      <code-block wrap="char" language="html" :code="`
&lt;iframe hidden name=htmz onload=&quot;setTimeout(()=>
document.querySelector(this.contentWindow.location.hash||':not(*)')
?.replaceWith(...this.contentDocument.body.childNodes))&quot;>&lt;/iframe>
`" />

      Turns out `':not(*)'` is _not_ necessary as a selector fallback. `querySelector` can accept null! Down to **176** bytes:

      <code-block wrap="char" language="html" :code="`
&lt;iframe hidden name=htmz onload=&quot;setTimeout(()=>
document.querySelector(this.contentWindow.location.hash||null)
?.replaceWith(...this.contentDocument.body.childNodes))&quot;>&lt;/iframe>
`" />

      Apparently, `this` is also unnecessary within inline attribute scripts when referring to the element itâ€™s attached to. Now down to **166** bytes (its final form as of today):

      <code-block wrap="char" language="html" :code="`
&lt;iframe hidden name=htmz onload=&quot;setTimeout(()=>
document.querySelector(contentWindow.location.hash||null)
?.replaceWith(...contentDocument.body.childNodes))&quot;>&lt;/iframe>
`" />

      Thatâ€™s about 90% of the original! Iâ€™m pretty sure this could be reduced further (`setTimeout` isnâ€™t strictly required) but Iâ€™m leaving it as it is. This code golfing diversion has been fun and I learned about HTML spec stuff that I wouldnâ€™t normally discover in my day job as a React framework user.

      ## Knowledge sharing
            
      Some commenters shared similar approaches and techniques. Some tips / workarounds on how to best utilise the snippet were thrown around. There were even discussions in the projectâ€™s Issue tracker on GitHub.

      <box-note>For one, the new [Sec-Fetch-Dest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Dest) header that someone mentioned is pretty cool. It lets the server know if the request is for an iframe or for a new tab, etc. Pretty handy for *hypertext* servers!</box-note>
      
      I learned lots and, not wanting to get these learnings lost into the archives, incorporated these tips into the main documentation, into the examples/demos, and some even became real-ish [extensions](//leanrada.com/htmz/extensions/):

      <blog-media :src="url('extensions.png')" alt="Screenshot of the Extensions page" />

      Itâ€™s a multi-way exchange. htmz and its iframe shenanigans have apparently inspired the creation of new HTML frameworks, such as [morphlex](https://github.com/joeldrapper/morphlex) and [htmf](https://github.com/callionica/htmf). I also saw people taking the idea into different directions, like using [iframes to lazy-load HTML partials](https://zenn.dev/kawarimidoll/articles/33316cf9caa465). I feel happy about having inspired people! There are even some who said so via the [guestbook](/guestbook/), which was especially nice!

      ## Future

      I think the htmz story is done and Iâ€™m already looking forward to my next project (the 7DRL challenge). Itâ€™s still getting some mentions in blogs, podcasts, here and there, but itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m gonna turn this into some serious full-time open-source project with versions and releases and (lack of) funds and all that jazz.
      
      GitHub activity (stars, issues, PRs) have slowed down as well. Thereâ€™s not much you can work with 166 characters, after all.
      
      But the idea lives on; may the snippet proliferate! :D
