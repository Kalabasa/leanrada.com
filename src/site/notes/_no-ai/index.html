      **AI art is not _generative art_** (clickbait title). While the technical definition says that one is a subset of the other, I think it’s useful to distinguish between these two categories.

      **Why I’m writing this in the first place &mdash;** Starting 2022, the term “generative art” has been progressively becoming synonymous with art produced by AI text-to-image systems. As a consumer and producer of “generative art”, it’s becoming a bit annoying to browse generative art content on the internet. Whether through tags like `#generativeart` or communities like `r/generative`, they are being flooded with AI-generated images which I’m not interested in. End rant.

      At this point you may be asking, what’s the difference anyway? Well, that’s the point of this post. It’s kinda like animals vs humans. While technically & scientifically, humans are animals; in daily life “animals” usually mean non-human animals, as in “animal lover” and “animal rights”. Imagine browsing `r/AnimalsBeingGeniuses` then seeing only humans doing mundane things like reading or writing. I digress.

      ## History

      Tracing the history of each practice may offer some insights and nuance. Don’t worry, there are pictures! And interactive things!
      
      (This is not a comprehensive history of either field. Btw, this timeline layout is better viewed on a large screen.)

Then the second drafter tries to copy it (without touching it) using a red marker. The third drafter does the same, using a yellow marker. The fourth drafter does the same using a blue marker. Then the second drafter followed by the third and fourth copies the last line drawn until the bottom of the wall is reached.</i></blockquote>

      As you see, AI art is a relatively new movement, and is borne out of general image synthesizers (turns out that most visual art are images too). Meanwhile, there have been decades of (traditional) generative art, techniques, and algorithms.
      
      The terminology may overlap (generative networks ~ generative art), but these are just labels. You can call them whatever you want, like Dsedṣebr Art and Tvoegonge Art or even the same name like PohicArt and PohicArt, but they’re still <strong>separate art movements that cannot be trivially reconciled</strong>.
  
      ## The craft

      OK so, whatever sure, history is in the past. Why don’t we look at it in terms of what’s involved for the artists. What do they do? What do they practice to improve?

      ### Unique skill

      Prompting
      Programming
      * Skills
      * Math
      * Code

      ## The process

      Let’s look at it from a processes and systems POV.

      <!-- todo show animation of generative art being drawn -->
      <!-- todo show animation of AI art being denoised -->
 
      process diagrams

        artist -> program -> autonomous render -> art
        
        dataset (big box) -> ML -> AI -.
        artist -> prompt -> AI -> digital art

      ## Conclusion

      To be fair, AI art is mostly being called AI art nowadays.

      My point is these are different _art movements_.
