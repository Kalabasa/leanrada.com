      **AI art is not _generative art_** (clickbait title). While the technical definition says that one is a subset of the other, I think it’s useful to distinguish between these two categories.

      **Why I’m writing this in the first place &mdash;** Starting 2022, the term “generative art” has been progressively becoming synonymous with art produced by AI text-to-image systems. As a consumer and producer of “generative art”, it’s becoming a bit annoying to browse generative art content on the internet. Whether through tags like `#generativeart` or communities like `r/generative`, they are being flooded with AI-generated images which I’m not interested in. End rant.

      At this point you may be asking, what’s the difference anyway? Well, that’s the point of this post. It’s kinda like animals vs humans. While technically & scientifically, humans are animals; in daily life “animals” usually mean non-human animals, as in “animal lover” and “animal rights”. Imagine browsing `r/AnimalsBeingGeniuses` then seeing only humans doing mundane things like reading or writing. I digress. Let’s look at the differences in different angles, starting with _lineages_.

      ## Lineages

      Tracing the history of each practice may offer some insights and nuance.

              Oh, and this must be where the confusion starts. The term generative in machine learning does not relate to generative art, but through many tongues, somehow generative AI art now belongs to the same class as generative art.

      ## Craft

      Let’s look at it in terms of the skills involved for the artists.

      * Skills
      * Math
      * Code

      ## Processes and systems

      Let’s look at it from a systems and processes POV.

      process diagrams

        artist -> program -> autonomous render -> art
        
        dataset (big box) -> ML -> AI -.
        artist -> prompt -> AI -> digital art

      ## Conclusion

      To be fair, AI art is mostly being called AI art nowadays.
