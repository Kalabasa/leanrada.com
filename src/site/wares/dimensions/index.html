      ## Generative art and augmented reality

      On August 2019, I made an augmented reality generative art experience for a small exhibit at the office where I worked.

      <project-info-card
        released="2019"
        platform="Web"
        tech="three.js, Vue.js, image processing"
        role="creator" />

      <blog-media
        alt="photo of exhibit"
        src="{url('media/dimensions_exhibit.jpg')}" />

      I joined the art exhibit because it sounded like a fun opportunity to push myself and learn new things!

      I knew right away that the medium had to be **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JS**, and I wanted it to somehow be an interactive experience.

      <blog-media
        src="{url('media/dimensions_xlikha.jpg')}"
        caption="Scrapped first attempt"
        spec="80% [400) 400" />

      After struggling for inspiration (and after one failed attempt), I’ve come up with a **generative art** and **augmented reality** concept.

      The general plan was to make two components — one physical print and one <abbr title="augmented reality">AR</abbr> app.

      I wrote about it in detail in the following posts:

      * [Part one: Generative art](part-one-generative-art/)
      * [Part two: Augmented reality](part-two-augmented-reality/)
