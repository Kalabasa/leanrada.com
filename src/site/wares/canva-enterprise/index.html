      # Canva for Enterprises marketing page

      <blog-media

      One of my first projects at Canva was a page that showcases the **Canva Enterprise** product. I was responsible for the dev work on its front page.

      <box-note>**Update:** So there’s [a newer version of the page now.](https://about.canva.com/enterprise) You can still see [my project’s version on archive.org.](https://web.archive.org/web/20190401230423/https://about.canva.com/enterprise/)</box-note>

      <project-info-card
        released="2018"
        platform="Web"
        tech="HTML, CSS, JS"
        role="developer" />

      It has some cool animations.

      <blog-media
        type="bleed"
        :src="url('media/canvaenterprise_2.mp4')" />

      The animations were implemented using a bunch of CSS 3D transforms, animations, and some JS to orchestrate it all.

      <blog-media
        :src="url('media/canvaenterprise_3.jpg')"
        caption="Mobile view" />

      I enjoyed animating the whole scene and doing all the little details (like how the shadows respond to the sheets’ heights).
