      # Personal website

      My personal website has been up for almost a decade now. Just like me, it has moved from place to place over the years. From a university server to GitHub pages to my own domain. It has also been redesigned multiple times.
      
      I make this site because I want a place on the web. While one could easily set up Facebook profiles, Twitter pages, LinkedIn profiles&hellip; those are more like apartments in someone elseâ€™s building. You could get zucced, your walls and doors could get renovated (UI redesign), furniture could get removed (dropped features). One might even find that the whole building has been demolished, like Google Plus. Also, ads. Do you want billboards in your home? Ok, the analogyâ€™s getting too far. But you get it.

      Well, itâ€™s also fun to keep as a hobby.

      Enough talk, more show. Letâ€™s take a look at what I could archive of the previous versions.

      ## Version 4 (2023)

      <blog-media
        type="windowed"
        alt="screenshot of v4"
        src="{url('media/v4.png')}"
        caption="leanrada.com" />

      This 2023 version is the current version as of 2023. This has been the most comprehensive version yet, featuring a blog, project pages, personal stuff, and random pages. I wanted this iteration to be more than a portfolio for professional purposes. I wanted a more personal website.

      | Tech stack  |         |
      |-------------|---------|
      | HTML/CSS/JS | Code    |
      | [compose-html](https://github.com/Kalabasa/compose-html) | Static site builder |
      | [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) | Hosting |
      | [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) | Domain |

      **compose-html** is my own static site builder, which I wouldnâ€™t yet recommend for the public. However, I like owning the framework as I could make my project in whatever form I wanted, and itâ€™s also interesting to make.

      There is no frontend UI framework. Plain HTML and JS are good enough. Iâ€™m good with my 100 Lighthouse performance score. ðŸ˜‰

      It features a nebula / lava lamp thing on the home page (and footer). Itâ€™s interactive, in case you didnâ€™t notice. In the code, itâ€™s a component named `&lt;nebula&gt;` and itâ€™s reusable with customisable palettes! Here it is on its own:

      <div class="nebula-demo-container">
        <nebula class="nebula-demo" palette="#ffffff #0000ff #ff0000 #000000" mouse />
      </div>

      <code-block language="html" :code='`\
<nebula
  palette="#ffffff #0000ff #ff0000 #000000"
  mouse />`'/>

      This was also the first time I got a domain! It was a choice between Google Domains, Porkbun, and Namecheap. Namecheap was the cheapest domain name registrar Iâ€™ve found. As for Google Domains, I donâ€™t know, thereâ€™s no guarantee it wonâ€™t just get dropped. Porkbun is nice and straightforward, but seems unknown&hellip;? I ended up on Namecheap and it was good so far.
    
      ## Version 3 (2018-2022)

      <blog-media
        type="windowed"
        alt="screenshot of v3"
        src="{url('media/v3.png')}"
        caption="kalabasa.github.io" />

      <script render>new Date().getFullYear() - 2018</script> years ago, this was how my site started to look. During that time, I wanted something more like a portfolio, a more professional thing as I was shopping around for work then. Thatâ€™s why I had that tagline (*cringe*). And my face. It also had a work experience section, so profesh.

      | [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) | Static site builder |

      | [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) | Hosting |
      | [Elasticlunr](http://elasticlunr.com/) | Search engine |

      It had a client-side search engine, which was pretty cool for a static site hosted on static GitHub Pages.

      What I like about this one is that it had page transitions, made using [Barba.js](https://barba.js.org/). Any page transition is always a nice delight while browsing the web, in my opinion. So I tried it for my own site.

      ## Version 2 (2015-2018)

      <blog-media
        type="windowed"
        alt="screenshot of v2"
        src="{url('media/v2.png')}"
        caption="kalabasa.github.io" />

      Ok, this was <script render>new Date().getFullYear() - 2015</script> years ago. A minimalist single-page site, containing just a very narrow selection of projects, a timeline of work experience, and links.

      <blog-media
        alt="screenshot of v2 splash screen"
        src="{url('media/v2-splash.mp4')}" />

      It featured an interactive splash screen with some 3D cubes, made with [three.js](https://threejs.org/). I think it looked cool.

      ## Version 1 (2012-2015)

      <blog-media
        type="windowed"
        alt="screenshot of v1"
        src="{url('media/v1.png')}"
        caption="agila.upm.edu.ph/~lgrada" />

      My very first website! I made this during college and hosted it on a university server. There was no build system, no deployment system. Real webmasters use raw FTP and SSH.

      Back then, I did the [Ludum Dare](https://ludumdare.com/) 48-hour game jams quite frequently, so this page was filled with the small games that I made.

      This was also where I hosted some of the CS projects that needed to be online. Thanks to the server being an actual machine (instead of just a static site), I was able to use databases, file storage, and execute backend logic.

      | PHP | Templating & backend |
      | [an Ubuntu Linux server](https://agila.upm.edu.ph/) | Hosting |

      The page featured a Flash-based interactive & animated header (seeing a pattern now?). I donâ€™t know why, but I just love interactive and animated stuff so I put these things in my site. Flash is dead now and no browsers support it, so hereâ€™s an HTML5 recreation!

      [todo: recreate the header]

      ## Conclusion

      Itâ€™s fun to make websites. Thatâ€™s why I keep remaking my website.
