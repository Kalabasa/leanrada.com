      # MiniForts

      ## A game about building and defending a fort.

      In 2021, I started making a small base-builder RTS game. It runs on the [**Minetest**](https://www.minetest.net/) voxel game engine.

      <project-info-card
        status="unreleased"
        platform="Minetest"
        tech="Lua, JSX"
        role="creator"
        button="View source"
        href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/mini_forts" />

      The goal of this game is to defend a central core from invaders. The player commands minions to build up a fort around the core.

      Minions are indirectly commanded by putting construction orders in the world.

        :src="url('media/miniforts_2.gif')" />

      It has some rudimentary physics, where structures disconnected from the ground get destroyed.

        :src="url('media/miniforts_3.gif')" />

      The game is not *complete*, but it’s decent enough for a few minutes of gameplay.

        type="bleed"

        :src="url('media/miniforts_1.gif')" />

      The game’s development slowed down as I found myself being limited with Minetest’s API and engine - particularly its client-server limitations. I guess it’s because Minetest is a first-person creative-survival voxel game "engine" - a Minecraft clone, if you will. It’s not particularly suited for a base-builder RTS experience.

      Here, I’ll write about some of the major and minor limitations and the solutions I came up with.

      ---

      ## The scripting language

      Minetest uses **Lua** as its scripting language, which I found limited for the scale of the project. For MiniForts, I needed strong-typing, advanced OOP, and some scalable UI DSL.

      So MiniForts was written in **TypeScript**. I used [**TypeScriptToLua**](https://typescripttolua.github.io/) to convert it to Lua that the game understands.

      With the addition of custom `.d.ts` declaration files, I was able to use Minetest’s API in a type-safe way. TypeScript also unlocked fancy OOP, very useful in developing a game, and JSX! More on JSX in the following section.

      ---

      ## The GUI engine

      One major problem was Minetest’s **GUI system**. It uses a procedural GUI model, where interactions and UI updates are procedural, as opposed to the modern declarative UI model. Furthermore, it uses absolute positioning and has a lack of nesting or layouting.

      To solve this I used [**JSX**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html), an XML-like syntax for defining UI in code.

      But Minetest is not a web browser. There isn’t anything in Minetest that knows how to render JSX elements. I had to create a **GUI engine** within the game that takes in JSX elements and renders it via Minetest’s APIs and that also works with the server-driven UI system that Minetest has.

      The end-result was a more flexible GUI system, with bonus reactive data-binding and callbacks.

      <table class="bleed">
        <td>
          <blog-media
            :src="url('media/miniforts_formspec.png')"
            caption="Minetest’s formspec"
            spec="300" />
        </td>
        <td>
          <blog-media
            :src="url('media/miniforts_tsx.png')"
            caption="JSX (TSX) version"
            spec="500" />
        </td>
      </table>

      Here’s an example layout which is the HUD that shows the player’s current resources in the upper-right corner of the screen:

      <blog-media
        alt="hud"
        :src="url('media/miniforts_hud.png')" />
      <blog-media
        alt="hud code"
        :src="url('media/miniforts_hud_code.png')" />

      It was pretty interesting to recreate a React-like environment on top of a very limited GUI API.

      ## Pathfinding

      Minetest has a built-in ground-based A* pathfinding algorithm, implemented in C++, exposed via the Lua API.

      I’ve found that the built-in pathfinder wasn’t sufficient for this game. This game has multiple agents with different locomotion types, a complex 3D terrain, and destructible walls.

      I ended up implementing a hierarchical pathfinding algorithm with a structure similar to [**RimWorld**’s region system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMBQn_sg7DA), also inspired by [**Castle Story**’s pathfinder](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025151/Hierarchical-Dynamic-Pathfinding-for-Large).

      <blog-media
        type="bleed"
        :src="url('media/miniforts_path.mp4')"
        caption="Pathfinder debug view in action" />

      The system divides the world into _components_, each of which is a volume that contains a set of positions reachable from one another.

      <blog-media
        alt="debug pathfinding"
        :src="url('media/miniforts_debug_path.png')"
        caption="Component debug view" />

      The pathfinder then finds a path through the component-level first, which is very fast, and only resolving voxel-level paths when the agent is trying to move within a component.

        :src="url('media/miniforts_order_path.mp4')" 
        caption="Very fast pathfinding over large distances" />

      ## World generation

      At the time, I was only able to create one world type - the Forest.

      <blog-media
        alt="forest"
        :src="url('media/miniforts_forest0.png')" />

      The terrain is a combination of stepped gradient noise maps generated from Minetest’s Perlin noise generator.

      The trees are positioned by placing points in a 2D grid and randomizing their locations within their grid cell.

      <blog-media
        alt="forest"
        :src="url('media/miniforts_forest1.png')" />

      The roots are generated from the difference of two gradient noise maps, creating these snaking patterns, with height falloff based on the nearest tree.

      ## The art

      I like pixel art. It’s easy to make passable results.

      <blog-media
        type="bleed"
        alt="art collection"
        :src="url('media/miniforts_art.png')"
        caption="See also, botom right corner, unfinished enemy type: the Dung Beetle. It would place blocks of dirt against your fort walls which would allow other enemies to climb over!"/>

      I struggled with the ground textures a lot. I realized that what’s more important at this resolution is the readability of something rather than the details of it.

      <blog-media
        type="bleed"
        alt="grass comparison"
        :src="url('media/miniforts_grass.gif')" />

      A lot of inspiration was drawn from **The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap**, which had similar miniature environments.

        :src="url('media/miniforts_zelda.jpg')"

      In the end, I was not able to publish this game to the game community because I felt like it was still incomplete in terms of features. The base game and systems were pretty good though. Anyway, it was still a fun project and a good nourishment for my game development hobby.
