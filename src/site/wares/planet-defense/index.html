      Made in 48 hours as my entry for the 38th [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com) game jam.

      Ludum Dare is a Game Jam (a hackathon for games) held every four months. A theme is announced and participants create a game from scratch in *48 hours*.

      I used to participate in these <abbr title="Ludum Dare">LD</abbr> jams frequently. In LD 38, the theme was **A Small World**. Immediately after the theme was announced, I went self-brainstorming for game concepts. Fortunately, I settled on an idea before the 12-hour mark.

      ## Missile Command, but circular.

      [Missile Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command) was an arcade game from the ’80s. The usual formula of taking a classic and giving it a twist was not very original, but time was limited. Minus points for Innovation, I guess.

      Several hours later, I managed to come up with a working game/prototype.

      Hooray! A finished game in exchange for precious hours of sleep!

      The game was made with [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com), a scene-graph based 2D graphics engine for JavaScript. I’m used to this graphics model since I started programming with Flash.

      I initially tried [Phaser](https://phaser.io), but it was too much for my taste. Having found out that Phaser uses Pixi underneath, I went with Pixi. I prefer the simple libraries.

      Overall it was an OK game. I think a mobile port would be appropriate, given the simple gameplay and controls.

      This game’s source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kalabasa/PlanetDefense). Not the prettiest code. It’s a hackathon!

      You can play it standalone [here](https://kalabasa.github.io/PlanetDefense). Contest entry page [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/planet-defense-1).
