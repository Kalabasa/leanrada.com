      ## Hypertangram is tangram with a twist.
      
      **Hypertangram** (2018) is a mind-bending geometric puzzle game on Android based on the classic tangram puzzle. What’s different with this one is that, in addition to regular dragging and rotating, *pieces can be resized*.

      The resizing mechanic adds a lot of state space to an otherwise regular [dissection puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection_puzzle).

      The idea had been sitting in the back of my mind for quite a time, and I finally did it in about 6 months of development in my free time.

      It wasn’t all smooth sailing. There were lots of problems with the geometry code.

      See, I didn’t want grid-based movement like in other tangram apps. I wanted free dragging, rotation, and scaling, with smart edge-snapping.

      This design decision proved to be technically demanding later on.

      But that’s not all. There were more *geometrials* ahead. Due to the nature of the main game mechanic, there can be several solutions to a single puzzle.

      There is no easy way to find them all by hand, nor by algorithm, as far as I know. The solution checking algorithm went through rounds of rethinking.

      I ended up with an algorithmic approach, using [boolean operations on polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_operations_on_polygons), in order to implement the win condition.

      *Note to self: Don’t mix geometric operations and floating point numbers. They are oil and water.*

      Other notable features include the smart edge-snapping (there is no grid, and no predetermined solution), and an accessible single-finger mode for resizing and rotating pieces without the need for a second finger.

      Aside from design & programming, I also created the music and graphics myself. For the look, I wanted it minimal with a physical feel. Abstract, yet tangible.

      The game’s graphics are procedurally rendered using Android’s [`Canvas`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas) API.

      I really liked what I did here. Of course, there’s always room for improvement, but finished is better than perfect.

      This was my first “complete” game in terms of features and polish.

      *It was a **geometriumph**.*

      Try it out! It’s free.
