			## Visualization of political dynasties in the Philippines.

			In Philippine politics, political dynasties are widespread. They are families who have maintained power for multiple generations through control of political positions.

			Political dynasties have long been associated with corruption, as they are able to use their power to pursue their own interests at the expense of the public.

			Using data visualization, we'll be able to see their prevalence across the country and gain insights about the correlation of dynasties with poverty and development.

			**Dynaviz** (2015) is a webapp for visualizing political dynasties and comparing it with other variables such as population and poverty indicators. This was my final project as an undergraduate student.

				:src="url('media/dynastymap_compare.png')" />

			Main features of the app are: computation of political dynasty indexes in <abbr title="Local Government Units">LGUs</abbr>, and visualization of dynasties along with various user-uploaded datasets.

			This webapp is an <abbr title="single-page application">SPA</abbr> made with [**React**](https://reactjs.org) and [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org). I used [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for the visualizations.

			Server-side is **PHP** with [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com) and [Medoo](https://medoo.in). I used **Python** for data processing, i.e., computation of dynasty variables and GeoJSON preprocessing.

			I got the data from [COMELEC](https://www.comelec.gov.ph) and [Open Data PH](https://www.gov.ph/data). I had to scrape election results from the 2015 COMELEC website because they didn’t have an API.

			This project was developed as a requirement (Special Problem) for my Computer Science B.S. degree. The idea of political dynasty visualization came from one of my professors. It was also inspired by Hans Rosling’s visualizations and [Trendalyzer](https://www.gapminder.org/tools).

			An instance of the app was hosted on the university’s server, but it has apparently been cleaned up now. So, no demo for you! :P
