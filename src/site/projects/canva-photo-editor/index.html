      ## Edit photos online
      
      **Photo Editor** (2019) was an online tool offered by [Canva](https://www.canva.com) for simple image editing. It had filters, sliders, and crop, resize, and rotation tools.
      
      Note that it's distinct from the Canva design app. This was more of a standalone tool for quick edits, with an ulterior purpose of marketing the primary Canva app.

      <box-note>**Update:** The standalone app has been decommissioned, and photo editing features are now part of the main app.</box-note>

      In the beginnng, the Photo Editor was a tool made by a third party developer in a proprietary UI framework on top of Angular 1 and Node 5.
      
      This version was very old and tbh a bit difficult to maintain and iterate on. It was also not responsive so mobile users were missing out.
      
      <blog-media
        alt="old version"
        src="img/canvaphotoeditor_old.jpg"
        caption="Old version"/>
      
      So a redesign was made and the app was rewritten in a more modern stack. The new version looks better, modern, and is responsive.
      
      My part in this redesign was coding the webapp and the welcome page.
      
      <blog-media
        type="bleed"
        alt="welcome page screenshot"
        src="img/canvaphotoeditor_3.jpg"
        caption="The welcome page" />
      
      I wrote the new app in [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) with [**MobX**](https://mobx.js.org/).
      
      There were a few WebGL and canvas filter algorithms from the old app that I reimplemented. Had to dip my toes into some fragment shaders for the WebGL version.

        src="img/canvaphotoeditor_2.jpg" />
      
      The backend is a simple server written with [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/) and the whole app was deployed on [**Heroku**](https://www.heroku.com/).

      After the launch we saw doubling in signups! ðŸ”¥ It was a fun project.
