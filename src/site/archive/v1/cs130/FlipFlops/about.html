    <h2>About</h2> 
    <i>from Wikipedia:</i>
    <div class="frame">
	<p>In electronics, a <b>flip-flop</b> or latch is a circuit that
        has two stable states and can be used to store state information. The circuit can be
        made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have
        one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in sequential logic.
        Flip-flops and latches are a fundamental building block of digital electronics systems
      used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.</p>
    </div>
    <p><b>Flip-Flop Logic Simulator</b> (FLS) is precisely what its name says it to be: a simulator
    for the logic of flip-flop circuits. FLS is written in JavaScript with an HTML/CSS frontend
    and some jQuery thrown in for good measure.</p>
    <h2>How-to</h2>
    <p>Using <b>FLS</b> is very straightforward. The onscreen instructions should suffice even
    for a novice user. This how-to manual is included <i>just in case</i>.</p>
    <div class="frame">
	<p>To start using the simulator, go to the <b>Simulator</b> page and click <b>start</b>.</p>
        <img src="res/1.png" alt="start button"></img>
        <p>You will then be asked to enter the number of variables e.g., flip-flops, inputs and outputs.</p>
        <img src="res/2.png" alt="number of variables"></img>
        <p>Enter your desired number of variables and then click <b>next</b>. You will then be asked
        what type of flip-flop will be used for each flip-flop circuit (dependent on your previous input).</p>
        <img src="res/3.png" alt="type of flipflops"></img>
        <p>Click on the radio button for the type of flip-flops and then click <b>next</b>.
        You will then be asked for the functions.</p>
        <img src="res/4.png" alt="flipflop functions"></img>
        <p>For contextual help on entering the functions, you may click the help button labeled as <b>?</b></p>
        <img src="res/5.png" alt="help"></img>
        <p>Once you have entered the functions, click <b>next</b>. The last part will be displayed. It shall
        contain the tables for inputs, present and next flip-flop states, flip-flop inputs and the outputs.
        There is also a search filter for viewing more specific parts of the tables.</p>

    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>Listed below are the known issues for FLS and their corresponding solutions or explanations.</p>
    <div class="frame">
        <p><b>Compatibility</b>. FLS is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It should be able to run on any
        operating system that has a modern JavaScript-enabled browser.</p>
        <p><b>Performance</b>. All operations are done on the client-side. The performance of FLS will depend
        on the amount of inputs and the processing power of your machine.</p>
        <p><b>SR Flip-Flop for (1,1)</b>. An SR flip-flop with a (1,1) input has an indeterminate output (X).
        However, FLS was made to <b>simulate</b>, and simulate it will. The unpredictability of the SR output
        is interpreted by FLS as a random value from 0 to 1.</p>
        <p><b>Legal / Licensing</b>. FLS is free and open-source software, but we still haven't decided on a
        license with which to release it. Until then, permission is granted to use, modify and redistribute as
        long as credit is given where credit is due.</p>
