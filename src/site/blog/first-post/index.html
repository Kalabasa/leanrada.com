      I’m starting a blog!

      I’ve done some blogging in the past (for gamedev), and I already do write-ups for my projects, so I think it’d be good to officially keep a blog!

      I have some ideas to populate the first few posts, then we’ll see how it goes from there.

      Watch this space!
