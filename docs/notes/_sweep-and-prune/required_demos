balls-demo
----------
* ball collisions
* animated algo naive solution
* animated algo of sweeping with inside tracking
* animated algo of sweeping with intersection callbacking
* animated algo of broadphase and narrowphase
* show simulation with sort & sweep steps - sort does nothing most of the time

abc-demo
--------
* interactive reorderable 3 objects in 1D with scoped-down intersects
* interactive reorderable with left and right points - highlight others that intersect with
* interactive reorderable with left and right points - with toggle between zero-width and

graph
-----
* real-time graph naive solution
* real-time graph sweep and prune insertion sort
* real-time graph sweep and prune w/ quicksort
