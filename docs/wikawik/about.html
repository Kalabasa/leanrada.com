        <p>
          Information presented in the web app is not guaranteed to be accurate.
          They were derived from public datasets of PSA and KWF. The PSA census
          tends to merge different minority languages into one, misrepresenting
          them. For example, various Aeta languages have been merged into one
          label called "Aeta/Agta". Another one is the lumping of Bicol
          languages into one.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were also many inconsistencies, even between PSA and KWF,
          especially on the classification of dialects versus languages. In
          order to get better representation of each language in the
          Philippines, I have modified the dataset based on other sources, such
          as Ethnologue and Glottolog. In the end, the goal was to showcase the
          languages of the Philippines and promote preservation of cultural
          heritage. Quantitative accuracy is secondary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Translated phrases were sourced from multiple places, such as Internet
          lists, language tutorials, chatter in public Facebook groups of
          tribespeople, bilingual dictionaries, and translated Bibles made by
          missionaries for indigenous people. If you are a native speaker or an
          expert, please let me know of any errors through the feedback form.

          Placement of markers (the person icon) on the map is only accurate to
          the provincial level. Within the province, they are scattered
          randomly. The marker might not exactly tell where the language is
          spoken within the province. This is evident in large provinces, like
          Quezon and Zamboanga del Sur.

          For simplicity, spellings were standardized using the Latin alphabet +
          Ñ, also known as the Filipino Alphabet. Diacritics were not added. It
          is important to note that not all Philippine languages are pronounced
          like Tagalog (i.e., pronounced plainly as spelled). There are some
          languages that have more than 5 vowels and cannot be fully expressed
          using the basic Filipino Alphabet. For example, in Aklanon, the
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Voiced_velar_fricative.ogg"
            target="_blank"
            >“e”</a
          >
          in <em>“Akeanon”</em> is pronounced as a consonant that sounds like
          something between “r” and “l”. In some other languages, like Maranao,
          the “e” may be pronounced as an
          <a
            href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mid-central_vowel.ogg"
            target="_blank"
            >“uh”</a
          >
          (schwa), as in <em>“Meranaw“</em>. (In general, beware of “e”s.) The
          Tagalog-based Ortograpiyang Pambansa prescribes spelling this as “ë”.
          Please consult a native speaker for proper pronunciation. Don’t try
          this at home.
