<p><img src="../img/genuary2022_thumb.jpg" alt="example"></p>
<h2 id="a-month-of-generative-art">A month of generative art</h2>
<p>As 2022 rolled in, I stumbled upon a site called <a href="https://genuary.art/" target="_blank"><strong>genuary.art</strong></a>. It’s a month of daily creative coding challenges, like <em>an Inktober for programmers</em>. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/genuary">Check it out!</a></p>
<p>The challenge was to create a <strong>generative art</strong> piece for every day of January. Each day there was a prompt, and each code art was supposed to be based on the day’s prompt.</p>
<p>Having done some <a href="dimension1.html">generative art</a> in the past, I committed myself to the challenge. Sounds like fun!</p>
<p>Here I’ll show you all of my Genuary 2022 works and some info about the techniques I used.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="day-01---draw-10000-of-something">Day 01 - Draw 10,000 of something.</h2>
<p><span class="bleed"><img src="../img/genuary2022_01.jpg" alt="genuary 01"></span>
<span class="caption">A hexagonal lattice of tiny lines.</span></p>
<p>10,000+ tiny lines are placed in a hexagonal pattern.</p>
<p>Each line’s length is mapped from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">coherent noise</a> map, resulting in this undulating structure.</p>
<p><img src="../img/genuary2022_01_det.jpg" alt="genuary 01"></p>
<p>The lines aren’t straight. They’re a bit wiggly for a more natural look, achieved by perturbing the line with Gaussian random values.</p>

<h2 id="day-02---dithering">Day 02 - Dithering.</h2>
<p><span class="bleed"><img src="../img/genuary2022_02.png" alt="genuary 02"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither"><strong>Dithering</strong></a> is a digital trick to create more shades than possible in a limited color palette. It creates the illusion of more shades by varying the distribution of pixels in an image.</p>
<p><img src="../img/genuary2022_02_det.png" alt="genuary 01"></p>
<p>My dithering technique was simple lattice patterns with 7 possible shades.</p>
<p>Some extra care was given to the boundaries between shades to prevent odd-looking clusters that result from accidental alignment with neighboring patterns.</p>

<h2 id="day-03---space">Day 03 - Space.</h2>
<p><span class="bleed"><img src="../img/genuary2022_03.jpg" alt="genuary 03"></span>
<span class="caption">Simulated watercolor painting of a nebula.</span></p>
<p>I tried simulating watercolor here.</p>
<p>The simulation consists of a moisture map, a color map, and the following model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any part of the canvas can be wet in varying degrees.</li>
<li>Moisture spreads and evaporates.</li>
<li><strong>Colors spread and bleed when wet.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Colors don’t spread when dry.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span><img src="../img/genuary2022_03_debug.png" alt="genuary 03"></span>
<span class="caption">Moisture map debug view.</span></p>
<p>The result wasn’t perfect. Some boundary errors resulted in dark blobs and unnaturally bright edges. I wasn’t able to fix it in time for the day. In any case, it looked OK.</p>
<p><img src="../img/genuary2022_03_det.jpg" alt="genuary 03"></p>

<h2 id="day-04---the-next-next-fidenza">Day 04 - The next next Fidenza.</h2>
<p><span class="bleed"><img src="../img/genuary2022_04.jpg" alt="genuary 04"></span>
<span class="caption">Fun with flow fields.</span></p>
<p><strong>Fidenza</strong> is a highly-valued ($$$) generative algorithm by <a href="https://tylerxhobbs.com/fidenza">Tyler Hobbs</a>, popular generative artist.</p>
<p>The core idea behind Fidenza is a flow field. So, I made flow field art.</p>
<p><span class="bleed"><img src="../img/genuary2022_04_0.jpg" alt="genuary 04"></span>
<span class="caption">Uncurated set generated just for this article.</span></p>
<p>Instead of using coherent noise to generate the field, I used poles. It’s a bit like how magnetic poles influence magnetic fields.</p>
<p>With fewer poles, the polar / radial structure of the field becomes obvious, while more poles result in more complex patterns.</p>

<h2 id="day-05---destroy-a-square">Day 05 - Destroy a square.</h2>
<p><span class="bleed"><img src="../img/genuary2022_05.jpg" alt="genuary 05"></span></p>
<p>Some abstract art involving lines across square frames. Feels like something that could be hung on a wall in some lobby somewhere.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="day-06---trade-styles-with-a-friend">Day 06 - Trade styles with a friend.</h2>
<p><span class="bleed"><img src="../img/genuary2022_06.jpg" alt="genuary 06"></span>
<span class="caption">Simulated cross-stitch of generated plants.</span></p>
<p>A friend gave me the prompt “cross-stitch”, and it was fun.</p>
<p>Everything was generated, from the canvas fabric, the threads, to the plant structures.</p>
<p>The smallest structure is the thread. A thread is simply a helix of colored curves with some highlights and shadows to imply depth.</p>
<p>At the opposite end of the scale is the largest structure, the plant. It is generated using a recursive <em>branch</em>ing algorithm (each branch can generate two smaller branches, and so on) with leaves at each node and potential flowers at the <em>leaf nodes</em>.</p>
<p><span><img src="../img/genuary2022_06_det.jpg" alt="genuary 06"></span>
<span class="caption">Backside simulation.</span></p>
<p>For fun, I wrote a backside simulation using a flood-fill algorithm.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="day-07---sol-lewitt-wall-drawing">Day 07 - Sol LeWitt Wall Drawing.</h2>
<p><span class="bleed"><img src="../img/genuary2022_07.jpg" alt="genuary 07"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt"><strong>Sol LeWitt</strong></a> once said: “The idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.” (1967)</p>
<p>LeWitt has been making drawing algorithms decades before generative computer art even existed. The instructions were executed by other people to produce the tangible art thing. It was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_art"><strong>conceptual art</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Now, JavaScript is doing the execution.</p>
<p><small>I also made some typewriter emulation on the side</small></p>

<h2 id="day-08---single-curve-only">Day 08 - Single curve only.</h2>
<p><span class="bleed"><img src="../img/genuary2022_08.jpg" alt="genuary 08"></span>
<span class="caption">Continuous line drawing of a face.</span></p>
<p>For this prompt, the idea of continuous line drawing immediately came into mind.</p>
<p>It’s the style of drawing where you don’t lift the pen until you finish the piece.</p>
<p><span class="bleed"><img src="../img/genuary2022_08_set.jpg" alt="genuary 08"></span>
<span class="caption">100+ outputs of the algorithm.</span></p>
<p>At the core of this piece is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory"><strong>graph algorithm</strong></a>.</p>
<p>First, I lay out all the possible contours of the face as a set of hardcoded curves. A diverse variation of proportions, angle, and facial expressions are randomly applied to the contours.</p>
<p>Then the curves are converted into a graph. Each of the curve’s endpoints becomes a node, which connects to its opposite endpoint as well as other nearby curves.</p>
<p><span><img src="../img/genuary2022_08_debug.jpg" alt="genuary 08"></span>
<span class="caption">Debug view of the graph.</span></p>
<p>Starting from a random curve, it performs a pathfinding algorithm, a variation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A*</a>, that maximizes the number of important contours and minimizes the jumps between curves.</p>
<p>The final path is then traced by a virtual pen with some physics for realistic-looking strokes.</p>

<p><span class="bleed"><img src="../img/genuary2022_11.jpg" alt="genuary 11"></span>
<span class="caption">Harmonograph drawings.</span></p>
<p>This was an interesting prompt. How do you make generative art without a computer to generate it?</p>
<p>I ended up building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonograph"><strong>harmonograph</strong></a> using cardboard and a scissor arm.</p>

<p>It was a nice change of pace. Though, unlike computer art, generating new pieces costed real paper and real ink. The physical world is messy.</p>

<h2 id="day-13---800x80">Day 13 - 800x80.</h2>
<p><span class="bleed"><img src="../img/genuary2022_13.jpg" alt="genuary 13"></span>
<span class="caption">Watercolor moons.</span></p>
<p>Apparently, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/800x80"><strong>#800x80</strong></a> is a thing.</p>
<p>A sequence of images depicting a process seemed like a good fit for the long format. So I settled on rendering phases of the moon.</p>
<p>I tried to simulate watercolor again using the same technique as Day 03. This time I was able to fix the bugs, and I think it looks more like watercolor now.</p>
<hr>
<p>As you might notice, I started skipping days at this point. Day 12 (Packing (squares, circles)) was missing. I was starting to get busy at work around this time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="day-21---combine-two-of-your-pieces-from-previous-days-to-make-a-new-piece">Day 21 - Combine two of your pieces from previous days to make a new piece.</h2>
<p><span class="bleed"><img src="../img/genuary2022_21.jpg" alt="genuary 21"></span>
<span class="caption">Cross-stitch flow fields.</span></p>
<p>This was an easy one, so I didn’t skip this prompt.</p>
<p><img src="../img/genuary2022_21_det.jpg" alt="genuary 21"></p>
<p>All I had to do was replace the plant generator in my cross-stitch renderer from Day 06 with a flow field image based on Day 04.</p>
<p>Some adjustments were made so that lines were able to overlap and fill the space, which looked great in cross-stitch.</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s it for now. I got a couple of WIPs for other days, but maybe I’ll hold off until Genuary 2023.</p>
<p>This was all made in <a href="https://p5js.org/"><strong>p5.js</strong></a>, a JS port of the Processing library.</p>
<p>Some other libraries were <a href="https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/"><strong>chroma.js</strong></a> for colors and <a href="https://github.com/spite/ccapture.js"><strong>ccapture.js</strong></a> to record videos.</p>
