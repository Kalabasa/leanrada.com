      **Stop using ease-out, or ease-in-out, or whatever-out, in every UI animation!**

      Before anything, let me present you with a set of controls without no context.

      (A table of interactive controls with ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out in randomized order. Analytics count the number of interactions for each ease type)

      There is a lot of propaganda on the internet against ease-in, saying that it's “unnatural”, “unusual”, or that it's “of the devil”. Some would even doublespeak and say that it's both “sluggish” and “abrupt” at the same time. Many pointing to ease-out as the safe, smooth, satisfying messiah of animation (and it's even safer kin, ease-in-out). There are published ‘best practices’ which can be summed up to [“just use ease-out”](https://web.dev/articles/the-basics-of-easing). This post is here to set things straight in a nonlinear fashion.

      So, why not ease-out? (And what to use instead?)

      ## 1. It’s overused

      Let’s get the weakest point out of the way. Ease out is boring because it’s everywhere. Because it’s part of the browser default `ease` function (which is a combination of a fast ease-in with a slow ease-out). Like how corners are getting rounder and rounder on the web simply because it's easy and built-in.

      Is the public missing out on better web animations (and better corners) because of these builtins?

      ## 2. It’s unrealistic

      Here’s a study in skeuomorphism. Imagine a mechanical toggle switch, like the common light switch.
      
      Here’s a simulation of a spring-based mechanical switch:

      <switch-sim />

      Drag your pointer horizontally and vertically across the simulation to control the presser appendage to control the switch.

      It’s a physically-based simulation with forces and constraints.

      What happens when you flip the switch?

      <switch-sim show-forces show-graph="force,position" timescale="0.1"/>

      Focus on the position over time.
