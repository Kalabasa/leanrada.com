      Before anything, let me present you with a set of controls with no context.

      <table class="demo-table">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <button class="demo-button ease-in">Press me</button>
          </td>
          <td>
            <button class="demo-button ease-out">Press me</button>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <input type="checkbox" class="demo-toggle ease-out" />
          </td>
          <td>
            <input type="checkbox" class="demo-toggle ease-in" />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      **Stop using ease-out, or ease-in-out, or whatever-out, in every UI animation!**

      There is a lot of propaganda on the internet against ease-in, saying that it's ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù, ‚Äúunusual‚Äù, or that it's ‚Äúof the devil‚Äù. Some say that it's both ‚Äúsluggish‚Äù and ‚Äúabrupt‚Äù. Many pointing to ease-out as the safe, smooth, satisfying messiah of animation (including its safer kin, ease-in-out). There are even published ‚Äòbest practices‚Äô which can be summed up to [‚Äújust use ease-out‚Äù](https://web.dev/articles/the-basics-of-easing). This post is here to set things straight &mdash; in a nonlinear fashion.

      So, why not ease-out? And what to use instead?

      ## Reason #1. It‚Äôs overused

      Let‚Äôs get the weakest point out of the way. Ease out is boring because it‚Äôs everywhere. Because it‚Äôs part of the browser default `ease` function (which is a combination of a fast ease-in with a slow ease-out). 
      
      It‚Äôs like how corners are getting rounder and rounder on the web simply because it's easy and built-in.

      <blog-media
        :src="url('figma-ease-out.gif')"
        caption="Source: Figma" />

      Is the public missing out on better web animations (and better corners) because of the ubiquity of these practices? Yes.

      ## Reason #2. It‚Äôs unrealistic

      How about a study in skeuomorphism?
      
      Imagine a mechanical toggle switch. Something like the following video:

      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l-G_uejx0Rs?si=g-RJXjgqsY8euukl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      Now here‚Äôs an interactive physics simulation of the same spring-based toggle switch:

      <div><switch-sim/></div>

      <box-note>*Drag your pointer horizontally and vertically across the simulation window to control the appendage that toggles the switch.*</box-note>

      This is a physics-based simulation with simulated forces, torques, and constraints. Let‚Äôs slow the simulation down and show some force lines for a better look.

      <div>
        <switch-sim show-forces="all" show-graph timescale="0.1">
          <p slot="before-graph">Graphing the angular position of the switch and the reaction force that resists your press (i.e. the normal force) over time in real time, gives us&hellip;</p>
        </switch-sim>
      </div>

      Play around with the simulation!

      Here‚Äôs what a typical motion looks like:

      <blog-media
        :src="url('typical.png')"
        caption="Typical output graph of the above simulation" />
    
      Notice the (red) position curve. <small>We'll get to the force curve later.</small> Does the position curve look anything familiar? Compare with some standard easing functions:

      <blog-media
        :src="url('standard-easing.png')"
        caption="Common easing functions. Source: MDN" />

      **The toggle switch‚Äôs position curve follows the ease-in curve!** A slow start, gradually building up momentum, then finally stopping to a satisfying ‚Äòclick‚Äô!
      
      Contrary to ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù, the natural motion of a toggle switch does not follow an ease-out nor an ease-in-out curve! I‚Äôll go further and say that ease-out is unnatural for any kind of UI control that represents a tactile interaction.

      Like buttons. In the real world, buttons (the ones that are nice to press anyway) have some kind of buckling mechanism when pressed. Similar to the toggle switch example above, there‚Äôs a buildup, a fall, and a final ‚Äòclick‚Äô into place.
      
      <blog-media
        :src="url('button.mp4')"
        caption="A button. In the real world." />

      Best practice says that the sharp stop is unnatural and should be avoided. But that well-defined resolution is part of what makes switches and buttons feel good. Just imagine a button that dampens the motion the more you press it. It‚Äôll feel squishy and mushy. You know what else slows down the further you go? Ease-out!

      <box-note>**Snap!** Try snapping your fingers. Did you do it? You just made an ease-in motion. [Don‚Äôt believe me?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DHQ4mKSZXU) When people say they want *snappy* animations, what do they really want?</box-note>

      And yet, thousands of UIs still use ease out for UI controls!

      <blog-media
        :src="url('examples.mp4')"
        caption="Ease out everywhere. One of these is a skeuomorphic rocker switch, ironically." />

      Has abstract UI design gone too far?

      ### Counterexamples

      Of course, not all UI animations need ease in, such as macro interactions, card movement, scrolling, expand/collapse, or any object that ‚Äòanimate themselves‚Äô as opposed to raw manipulation.

      <blog-media
        :src="url('material-pager.mp4')"
        caption="Source: Material Design" />

      Unlike switches and buttons, these things don‚Äôt have a frame or housing that can immediately stop them when they ‚Äòbottom out‚Äô. So they have to decelerate naturally.

      In the end, it depends. But as a general rule? Ease-in for tactile things.

      ## Reason #3. Ease-in is more satisfying

      <blog-media
        :src="url('typical.png')"
        caption="The graph again. This time focus on the force curve." />
    
      If you‚Äôre a mechanical keyboard enthusiast, you might‚Äôve recognised the general landmarks in the force curve above. That ‚Äòtactile bump‚Äô and subsequent drop in force is a big part of what provides the satisfying feedback that mechanical keys are known for (and coincidentally, produces the ease-in motion).

      <blog-media
        :src="url('cherry.png')"
        caption="Force curve of a tactile keyboard switch. Source: deskthority.net" />

      But *why* is it satisfying?

      <box-note>**Disclaimer:** This is getting into subjective and pseudoscience territory.</box-note>

      I present my sub-thesis:
      
      > **The sequence of tension and release is intrinsically satisfying.**
      > <cite>me</cite>

      I will now present supporting evidence with xkcd-style graphs.

      ### A. Popping bubble wraps

      <blog-media
        :src="url('bubble-wrap.png')"
        caption="Estimated force curve of popping a bubble in a bubble wrap." />

      Popping bubble wraps is a satisfying sensation. Popping a bubble in a bubble wrap follows the familiar buildup, release, and resolution pattern that is associated with ease-in.

      <small>[Relevant xkcd.](https://xkcd.com/2458/)</small>

      ### B. Scratching an itch

      <blog-media
        :src="url('itch.png')"
        caption="Estimated discomfort experienced during an itch‚Äôs lifetime." />

      While the act of scratching by itself is mildly pleasurable, when paired with an itchy skin, it becomes a satisfying experience.

      ### C. Music theory

      üöß This section is WIP, something about dissonance and consonance üöß

      ### D. Arousal jag theory

      > The abrupt fall from elevated levels of arousal to a lower, more appropriate level is thought to produce a pleasurable response.
      > <cite>APA Dictionary of Psychology, [‚Äòarousal jag‚Äô](https://dictionary.apa.org/arousal-jag)</cite>

      This theory was introduced by a psychologist named Daniel E. Berlyne in 1970. The idea is that an increase in tension followed by a sharp decrease produces a satisfying feeling. This framework works well for ease-in‚Äôs case in the context of the force curve, or more directly, with ease-in‚Äôs initial slow buildup followed by its abrupt resolution.

      If you‚Äôre looking for the psychology behind microinteractions, well, that‚Äôs one of them.

      ### E. The Three-Act Structure

      <blog-media
        :src="url('3act.png')"
        caption="The three-act structure with a tension graph." />

      In storytelling or filmmaking, the [three-act structure](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeActStructure) is a model for analysing or creating good stories. It mirrors the tension-resolution sequence in a grander scale. And with bigger scope comes the potential for a higher level of satisfaction &mdash; *catharsis*. Great stories that use the three-act structure always leave you in a state of catharsis.

      Is it possible to have micro-catharses in UI animations?

      ---

      All of these patterns of satisfaction reflect ease-in‚Äôs slow buildup and sudden resolution. While there are other kinds of satisfying phenomenon, like [sand slicing](https://youtu.be/3clqk2U3T9Y) which has nothing to do with any of this; tension and release is a good way to induce the positive effect.

      Now, this could be taken the wrong way. Does *‚Äòthe longer the tension, the sweeter the release‚Äô* mean that we should make ease-in‚Äôs slow start even slower to make it better? No, there is a balance, and it‚Äôs relative to the scale of the thing. A bubble wrap that is really hard to pop would be quite annoying, and a grand story that ends quickly would be disappointing. For buttons and toggles, keep it bubble wrap popping short. 

      ## Conclusion

      Don‚Äôt use ease-out in everything! Try ease-in!

      ### Tips

      * Use a custom curve. Don‚Äôt use the default ease-in because it‚Äôs likely to feel too slow for most use cases. In CSS, there‚Äôs `bezier-curve()` for custom curves.
      * Partially start the animation on pointer press, not on release.
