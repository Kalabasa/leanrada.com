    <h2>Source</h2> 
    <p>As <b>Flip-Flop Logic Simulator</b> (FLS) is written in JavaScript, its source is accessible to anyone
    by just viewing the source of the Simulator page. <a href="res/flipflop.js" target="_new">Here</a> is a
    direct link to the source code.</p>
    <p><b></b></b>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>The JavaScript code is divided into 6 parts: Starter, Numbers, Types, Functions, Table, Helpers.</p>
     <p>The actual process is divided into 4 main parts: GUI, Input Parsing, Function Evaluation, Table Generation.</p>
    <div class="frame">
	<h2>GUI</h2>
        <p>The bulk of the GUI is composed of the HTML in index.html and the auxiliary functions in Starter and Helpers.
        The specific elements of each "part" is also covered in the Numbers, Types, Functions, Table parts.</p>
        
        <h2>Input Parsing</h2>
        <p>The GUI is heavily involved in taking inputs. As you can see, the inputs for each part of the simulation
        depend on the previous one. They are dynamically generated.</p>
        <p>The <b>validateFunc</b> function under the Functions part is responsible for making sure the formats of
        the input boolean functions are correct. It utilizes a weight system to ensure valid pairs of parenteheses.
        The rest of the boolean function is validated with a regular expression (regex):</p>
        <p style = "text-align: center;"><i>\s*((\(*\s*[a-z10]\s*(\)?'?)+)+\s*\+\s*)*(\(*\s*[a-z10]\s*(\)?'?)+)+\s*</i></p>
        
        <h2>Function Evaluation & Table Generation</h2>
        <p>The evaluation of the boolean functions is made easy by JavaScripts built-in <b>eval()</b> function.
        Here it can be found implicitly used in the <b>evalFunc()</b> in the guise of the line:</p>
        <p style = "text-align: center;"><i>var func = new Function("vars", "return " + str + ";");</i><</p>
        <p><b>eval()</b> is infamous for being a security vulnerability as it is prone to JavaScript injection
        or the running of malicious code by a user. We still chose to use it annyway because (1)as an educational
        project, there is little to compromise in FLS and (2)it really simplifies the process of evaluating functions.</p>
        <p>There is one problem with <b>eval()</b> however: it can only read functions in the format used in most
        programming languages e.g., && for AND, || for OR, ! for NOT. A function such as:</p>
        <p style = "text-align: center;"><i>ab + c(d'e)'</i></p>
        <p>must be converted to</p>
        <p style = "text-align: center;">A && B || C && !(!D && E)</p>
        <p>The <b>convertFunc()</b> accomplishes this via a programmatic approach for the NOT operators and
        a handful of regex replacements for the rest.</p>
        <p>The values of the State Table are then determined from the inputs and the flip-flop functions. The
        specific flip-flop logic/behaviors are taken care of by the <b>evalFF()</b> function.</p>
