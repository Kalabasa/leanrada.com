      **9-slicer** is a tool used for generating CSS for rendering [9-slice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-slice_scaling) images.

      _9-slice_ is an image resizing technique that preserves the borders and corners of an image. This simplifies the process of creating scalable and stylised UI components.

      ## How it works

      It uses the CSS property `border-image` to define the 9 scaling zones.
      
      The `border-image` property can do a lot more than the scale 9-slices of an image, but I chose to focus on the simple 9-slice use-case because there are already many *border image generators* online that expose the full range of `border-image` options but were not very intuitive and simple. In any case, the user can edit the resulting CSS, and I even included a tip for the user to explore the full possibilities of `border-image`.

      Some additional features would be good though, like zooming in and out! Or snapping! Slice mirroring? Auto-detection of slices?? Useless AI assistant!? Iâ€™ll check these out when/if I revisit the project.
