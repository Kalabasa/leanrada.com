      ## Fast-paced JavaScript coding game
      
      **BlitzCoding** is a fast-paced programming game for JavaScript that you can play on the web. Test your JS skills!
      
      <project-info-card
        released="2021"
        platform="Web"
        tech="React, TypeScript"
        role="creator"
        button="Play online"
        href="https://kalabasa.github.io/blitz-coding/" />

        playback-rate="1.5" />
    
      In the game, you face a series of function stubs to implement, having only the function name as a hint and test cases as the spec. Within seconds you must write the function correctly and pass all the test cases.

      The game features a lot of small to medium programming challenges, from simple math formulas to factorials, sequences, object mappings, and array reductions.

      Random **Modifiers** are little game changers that impose certain restrictions on the round, such as disabling certain methods, banning operations, banning certain language constructs like loops.

        spec="100% [1200) 80%" />
    
      Imagine computing a sum but not being able to use the addition and subtraction operations.

      For the record, hereâ€™s how I would compute a sum without using addition: Iâ€™ve come up with a tallying system, but it only works with positive numbers!

      I think a big part of the fun in this game was playing around the modifiers, coming up weird ways to solve a problem.
      
      There are four levels of difficulty, with the hardest one involving lots of modifiers, and sometimes, *emoji strings* ðŸ†˜. I mean, I wouldnâ€™t be able reverse a string with emojis myself, but it was funny to put those in anyway.

      It was an interesting project involving JavaScript parsing, JS "VM"s / sandboxes, meta unit testing, and silly JavaScript quirks.
      
      Try it out! (or just watch some gameplay clips)
