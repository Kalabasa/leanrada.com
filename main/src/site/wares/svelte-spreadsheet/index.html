      A very simple spreadsheet built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).
      
      I discovered Svelte in 2019. It‚Äôs really interesting - a reactive component-based framework without the runtime bulk. There is no VDOM! Apparently, the DOM is updated directly with precise efficiency.
      
      > Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.

      So, I wanted to try it on a simple webapp. A spreadsheet app seems to be a good case for this. See, a cell can have formulas, which are derived from other cells. The spreadsheet model is inherently *reactive*.
      
      Among the modern reactive UI frameworks, Svelte syntax is most similar to Vue, with one notable distinction: The script part is not required to be a subclass / object / function. It‚Äôs plain flat script!
      
      <blog-media

        :src="url('media/sheetz_code.png')" />
      
      It‚Äôs somehow liberating to not have to extend framework classes or follow predefined object shapes. There is no *"framework"*.
      
      The Svelte compiler acheives this by statically analyzing the source then tailoring the code to update the DOM at the correct times and places.
      
      Verdict: Very cool üëç
      
      ### Spreadsheet features
      
      - Formulas (arithmetic only). JavaScript syntax. (`=1 + 2`)
      - Absolute references. (`=A1 + A2`)
      - Error detection (cyclic reference detection, syntax errors).
      
      ### Not implemented (yet?)
      
      - Math functions.
      - Relative references.
      - Lazy evaluation.
